<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>
    Many spam and abuse prevention techniques rely on users being able to report
    other users who are sending unwanted messages, or specific instances of
    abuse. &xep0191; allows users to block spammers, but does not provide a
    mechanism for them to report a reason for the block to the server operator.
    This specification extends the blocking command to optionally provide an
    abuse report.
  </p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Discovering Support' anchor='disco'>
  <p>
    Entities that support &xep0030; and abuse reporting MUST respond to service
    discovery requests with a feature of 'urn:xmpp:reporting:0' and with a
    feature for each reason supported by the responding entity as described in
    the relavant specifications. Eg. a response from a server that supports
    reporting and understands the abuse and spam reasons defined later in this
    specification might look like the following:
    <example caption="Service discovery information response"><![CDATA[
<iq from='shakespeare.lit'
    id='ku6e51v3'
    to='kingclaudius@shakespeare.lit/castle'
    type='result'>
  <query xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/disco#info'>
    <feature var='urn:xmpp:reporting:0'/>
    <feature var='urn:xmpp:reporting:reason:abuse:0'/>
    <feature var='urn:xmpp:reporting:reason:spam:0'/>
  </query>
</iq>
    ]]></example>
  </p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Payload' anchor='payload'>
  <p>
    The payload for reporting abuse to the server takes the form of a
    &lt;report/&gt; qualified by the 'urn:xmpp:reporting:0' namespace &VNOTE;.
    Report payloads are reusable and MUST NOT be sent without first being
    wrapped in a stanza.
  </p>
  <example caption='The most basic report payload'><![CDATA[
<report xmlns="urn:xmpp:reporting:0" />]]></example>
  <p>
    Abuse reports MAY include a reason for the report and servers MUST tolerate
    unknown XML elements in a report without making assumptions about the
    semantic meaning of unknown elements.
  </p>
  <p>
    This document defines the following reasons for a report:
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt>&lt;spam/&gt;</dt>
    <dd>Used for reporting a JID that is sending unwanted messages.</dd>
    <dt>&lt;abuse/&gt;</dt>
    <dd>Used for reporting general abuse.</dd>
  </dl>
  <p>
    Clients MUST include only one reason per report.
  </p>
  <p>
    Reports MAY contain a user provided message explaining or providing context
    about the reason for the report. See also the
    <link url='#i18n'>Internationalization Considerations</link> section of this
    document.
  </p>
  <example caption='Report with optional reason and text'><![CDATA[
<report xmlns="urn:xmpp:reporting:0">
  <text xml:lang="en">
    Never came trouble to my house like this.
  </text>
  <spam/>
</report>]]></example>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Use with the Blocking Command' anchor='blocking'>
  <p>
    To send a report, a report payload MAY be inserted into an &lt;item/&gt;
    node sent as part of a request to block a spammer as defined in &xep0191;.
    For example:
  </p>
  <example caption='Report sent with blocking command'><![CDATA[
<iq from='juliet@capulet.com/chamber' type='set' id='block1'>
  <block xmlns='urn:xmpp:blocking'>
    <item jid='romeo@montague.net'>
      <report xmlns="urn:xmpp:reporting:0">
        <abuse/>
      </report>
    </item>
  </block>
</iq>]]></example>
  <p>
    Servers that receive a blocking command with a report MUST block the JID or
    return an error just as they would if no report were present. Servers then
    MAY take other actions based on the report, however, such actions are
    outside the scope of this document.
  </p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Implementation Notes' anchor='impl'>
  <p>
    Clients that support sending reports as part of the blocking command SHOULD
    expose interfaces to both block a JID without reporting it as abusive, and
    to block and report a JID.
  </p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Internationalization Considerations' anchor='i18n'>
  <p>
    If one or more &lt;text/&gt; elements are present they SHOULD include
    'xml:lang' attributes specifying the natural language of the XML character
    data.
  </p>
</section1>
  <section1 topic='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>
    <p>
      This document introduces no additional security considerations above and
      beyond those defined in the documents on which it depends.
    </p>
  </section1>
  <section1 topic='IANA Considerations' anchor='iana'>
    <p>This document requires no interaction with &IANA;.</p>

    <section2 topic='Protocol Namespaces' anchor='registrar-ns'>
      <p>This specification defines the following XML namespace:</p>

      </ul>
      <p>
        Upon advancement of this specification from a status of Experimental to
        a status of Draft, the &REGISTRAR; shall add the foregoing namespace to
        the registry located at &DISCOFEATURES;, as described in Section 4 of
        &xep0053;.

    <section2 topic='Abuse Reporting Registry' anchor='registrar-reporting'>
      <p>
        The XMPP Registrar shall maintain a registry of abuse report reasons.
        All abuse report reason registrations shall be defined in separate
        specifications (not in this document). Application types defined within
        the XEP series MUST be registered with the XMPP Registrar, resulting in
        protocol URNs of the form "urn:xmpp:reporting:reason:name:X" (where
        "name" is the registered name of the reason and "X" is a non-negative
        integer).

      <p>
        Upon advancement of this specification from a status of Experimental to
        a status of Draft, the &REGISTRAR; shall add the following definition to
        the abuse reporting reasons registry, as described in this document:
        <code><![CDATA[<reason>

  <urn>urn:xmpp:reporting:reason:spam:0</urn>

      Thanks to the participants of the XMPP Summit 20 in Austin, TX who
      discussed this XEP: specifically to Waqas Hussain, Kevin Smith, Lance
      Stout, and Matthew Wild. A special thanks to Daniel Wisnewski for giving
      the presentation that kicked off the anti-abuse work.
