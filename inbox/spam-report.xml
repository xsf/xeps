<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>
    Many spam and abuse prevention techniques rely on users being able to report
    specific instances of abuse, or other users who are sending unwanted
    messages. &xep0191; allows users to block spammers, but does not provide a
    mechanism for them to report a reason for the block to the server operator.
    This specification extends the blocking command to optionally provide a
    reason.
