<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>
    Many spam and abuse prevention techniques rely on users being able to report
    other users who are sending unwanted messages, or specific instances of
    abuse. &xep0191; allows users to block spammers, but does not provide a
    mechanism for them to report a reason for the block to the server operator.
    This specification extends the blocking command to optionally provide a
    reason.
  </p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Payload' anchor='payload'>
  <p>
    The payload for reporting abuse to the server takes the form of a
    &lt;report/&gt; element containing an optional plaintext message, and a
    reason for the report (spam, abuse, etc.). Report payloads are reusable and
    MUST NOT be sent without first being wrapped in a stanza.  For instance, the
    following is a valid report:
  </p>
  <example><![CDATA[
<report xmlns="urn:xmpp:reporting:0">
  <text xml:lang="en">
    Never came trouble to my house
  </text>
  <spam/>
</report>
]]>
  </example>
  <p>
    Abuse reports MAY include a reason for the report and servers MUST tolerate
    unknown XML elements in a report without making assumptions about the
    semantic meaning of unknown elements.
  </p>
  <p>
    This document defines the following reasons for a report:
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt>&lt;spam/&gt;</dt>
    <dd>Used for reporting a user who is sending unwanted messages.</dd>
    <dt>&lt;abuse/&gt;</dt>
    <dd>Used for reporting general abuse.</dd>
