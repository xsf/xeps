<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>
    Many spam and abuse prevention techniques rely on users being able to report
    other users who are sending unwanted messages, or specific instances of
    abuse. &xep0191; allows users to block spammers, but does not provide a
    mechanism for them to report a reason for the block to the server operator.
    This specification extends the blocking command to optionally provide a
    reason.
  </p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Payload' anchor='payload'>
  <p>
    The payload for reporting abuse to the server takes the form of a
    &lt;report/&gt; element containing an optional plaintext message, and a
    reason for the report (spam, abuse, etc.). Report payloads are reusable and
    MUST NOT be sent without first being wrapped in a stanza.  For instance, the
    following is a valid report:
  </p>
  <example><![CDATA[
<report xmlns="urn:xmpp:reporting:0">
  <text xml:lang="en">
    Never came trouble to my house
  </text>
  <spam/>
</report>
]]>
  </example>
  <p>
    Abuse reports MAY include a reason for the report and servers MUST tolerate
    unknown XML elements in a report without making assumptions about the
    semantic meaning of unknown elements.
  </p>
  <p>
    This document defines the following reasons for a report:
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt>&lt;spam/&gt;</dt>
    <dd>Used for reporting a user who is sending unwanted messages.</dd>
    <dt>&lt;abuse/&gt;</dt>
    <dd>Used for reporting general abuse.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>
    If one or more &lt;text/&gt; elements are present they SHOULD include

    data.

      <p>This specification defines the following XML namespace:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>urn:xmpp:reporting:0</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Upon advancement of this specification from a status of Experimental to
        a status of Draft, the &REGISTRAR; shall add the foregoing namespace to
        the registry located at &DISCOFEATURES;, as described in Section 4 of
        &xep0053;.
      </p>
    </section2>
    <section2 topic='Abuse Reporting Registry' anchor='registrar-reporting'>
      <p>
        The XMPP Registrar shall maintain a registry of abuse report reasons.
        All abuse report reason registrations shall be defined in separate
        specifications (not in this document). Application types defined within
        the XEP series MUST be registered with the XMPP Registrar, resulting in
        protocol URNs of the form "urn:xmpp:reporting:reason:name:X" (where
        "name" is the registered name of the profile and "X" is a non-negative
        integer).

      <code>

    <section2 topic='Abuse Reporting Reasons' anchor='registrar-reasons'>
      <p>This specification defines the following abuse reporting reasons:</p>

        Upon advancement of this specification from a status of Experimental to
        a status of Draft, the &REGISTRAR; shall add the following definition to
        the abuse reporting reasons registry, as described in this document:
        <code><![CDATA[<profile>
  <name>Spam</name>
  <urn>urn:xmpp:reporting:reason:spam:0</urn>
