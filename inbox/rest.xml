<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>Representational State Transfer (<cite>REST</cite>) is an architectural style that is a coordinated
  set of constraints which also apply to the web. It aims at simplifying component implementations, reducing
  the complexity of distributed software elements, improving the performance, and increasing the 
  scalability. In relation to the definition of a RESTful application programming interface (API)
  the uniform interface constraint is of high importance. It simplifies and decouples the architecture
  and makes REST components independent. The constraints for a uniform interface can be reduced to:
  the identification of resources, the self-descriptive representation of resources, and the 
  self-descriptive manipulation of resources.</p>
  <p>REST systems typically communicate over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and are gaining 
  large acceptance due to its
  growing support and its simplicity for implementation. RESTful web services
  are in this context a simpler alternative to &w3soap; and WSDL-based Web services which are specified 
  for the use with XMPP
  in &xep0072; and also a more powerful alternative to &xmlrpc; which are specified as XMPP extension 
  in &xep0009;.</p>
  <p>The &xep0332; allows for designing REST services in the context of XMPP, but requires an implementation
  of both protocols: XMPP and HTTP. Furthermore, HTTP was selected in the past because of its 
  degree of popularity, but has some drawbacks like the lack of discoverability of services.
  The REST with XMPP extension is a powerful protocol for cloud services that has 
  several advantages in contrast to the traditional HTTP-based REST approach:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>services are discoverable and explorable,</li>
    <li>asynchronous invocation can be performed in parallel,</li>
    <li>generation of clients on the fly based on the capabilities of resources, and</li>
    <li>multiple input and output types definitions are possible.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The REST with XMPP protocol makes use of the &IQ; stanza in order to enable access, to create, to delete,
  or to modify resources within a XMPP network overlay. This specification defines two XML Schema files:
  one for exploring the capabilities of a resource and one for performing actions on a resource.</p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Requirements' anchor='reqs'>
  <p>The author has designed the REST with XMPP protocol with the following requirements in mind:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li><p>REST with XMPP should be easy to implement such as it is with REST over HTTP.</p></li>
  	<li><p>This specification should apply the REST architectural style to XMPP and should eliminate limitations of HTTP.</p></li>
  	<li><p>Resources should be linkable in terms of static connections as well as link targets used for resource access and modifications.</p></li>
  	<li><p>The number of request and <strong>response</strong> parameters, representations and links should be unbounded.</p></li>
  	<li><p>The number of operations should be unlimited as in contrast to HTTP's GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods.</p></li>
  </ul>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Resource Exploration' anchor='restdis'>
  <p>In order to explore the capabilities of a resource, the &IQ; stanza type "get" have to be used. The returned 
  &IQ; stanza is either of type "error" or "result". If it is of type "result", the returned content has to be
  complied with the xwadl schema of this specification. The xwadl schema has been designed for providing a machine 
  process-able description of a resource. It was inspired by the Web Application Description Language (WADL)
  standard delivered by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</p>
  <p>An &IQ; stanza of type "get" is returning an &IQ; stanza of type "result" that describes all actions that the
  requesting party can perform. The following example shows an exploration of a cloud provider's REST based 
  interface for handling compute services.</p>
      <!-- computeExplorationRequestIQ.xml -->
      <example caption='Exploration of an OpenStack interface for handling compute services'><![CDATA[

    id='rest1'>
  <resource_type xmlns="urn:xmpp:rest-xwadl" path="/compute" />
</iq>
      ]]></example>
  <p>In order to explore a resource, only the path to a resource is required. The counter party has to
  answer of such a request with a response that exposes all possible actions which can be performed on the 
  resource located at the specified path. The following example illustrates a response that exposes all
  actions for this resource.</p>
      <!-- computeExplorationResponseIQ.xml -->
      <example caption='Result of an exploration for handling compute services'><![CDATA[

  <p>This response exposes two methods that can be performed on the 
  resource located at "/compute". The first method "create" can be used to create one or
  more virtual machines (VM). This method has three input parameters in its request and one output
  parameter in its response. If a client would like to perform this method, at least only a link to
  the location of an image is required. The other two parameters are optional. The server will respond to this 
  method with a list of links to the instantiated VMs. A detailed example of how to access this method is 
  illustrated in the <link url='#restaccess'>Resource Access</link> section.</p>
  <p>The following subsections describe each component of a xwadl document in detail.</p>
  <section2 topic='Resource Type' anchor='restdis-resourcetype'>
    <p>The "resource_type" element forms the root of a xwadl document and MAY comprises the following 
    sub-elements: "doc", "grammars", and "method"</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Documentation' anchor='restdis-documentation'>
    <p>Each xwadl-defined element down to the "param" can have one or more child "doc" elements that 
    can be used to document that element. The doc element has "title" attributes which is a short plain 
    text description of the element being documented. The "doc" element can have mixed content 
    and may contain text and zero or more child elements.</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Grammars' anchor='restdis-grammars'>
    <p>The "grammars" element acts as a container for definitions of the format of data exchanged 
    during execution of the protocol described by the xwadl document and SHOULD be according to the  
    XML Schema definition.</p>

      ]]></example>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Method' anchor='restdis-method'>
    <p>A method element describes the specific actions that can be performed on a resource targeted 
    by the "path" attribute of the "resource_type" element.
    A method element is a child of a "resource_type" element and has a "name" attribute
    that identifies this method.</p>
    <p>Additionally, each "method" MUST have one "request" and one "response" element
    which can be empty or be used to expose the optional parameters that this method can execute.</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Request and Response' anchor='restdis-reqeesp'>
    <p>The "request" and the "response" element are according to the xwadl schema of type "call". They are 
    identical by definition and describe the input and output data for accessing a resource.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A <strong>request</strong> describes the <strong>input</strong> to the method as a collection of parameters.</li>
      <li>A <strong>response</strong> describes the <strong>output</strong> to the method as a collection of parameters.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Both elements describe the information to be included when applying a method to a resource.
    Both elements have no attributes and may contain one or more "param" elements as child elements.</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Parameter' anchor='restdis-parameter'>
    <p>A "param" element describes a parameterized component of its parent element (either a request or a 
    response). It can be identified by its "name" attribute and MUST have a minimum of one "option" element 
    that defines one of a set of possible 
    values for the parameter. In order to parameterize a component, the "param" element SHOULD specify 
    a combination of the following attributes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>name</strong> attribute specifies the name of the parameter and is a required attribute.</li>
      <li>The <strong>default</strong> attribute specifies an OPTIONAL default value that is applied if this
      parameter is not used while accessing a resource. If this attribute is specified, the overall parameter 
      element is optional when accessing a resource.</li>
      <li>The <strong>required</strong> attribute is an OPTIONAL element and can be either false or true (default is false).
      It indicates whether the parameter is required to be present or not.</li>
      <li>The <strong>repeating</strong> attribute is an OPTIONAL element and can be either false or true (default is false).
      It indicates whether the parameter is single valued or may have multiple values.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some combinations of attributes do not make sense, e.g. the specification of "default=?" and "repeating=true", 
    and SHOULD be considered application specific.</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Option' anchor='restdis-option'>
    <p>An "option" element defines one of a set of possible types, representations, link type, or also values 
    for the parameter. An "option" element MUST have one of the following attributes:</p>
    <dl>
      <di>
        <dt>type</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>The "type" attribute indicates one possible type of the parameter as an XML qualified name, 
          defaults to xs:string. It SHOULD specify the type of a single optional value. Multiple options
          with the same type but different values SHOULD specify a set of possible values which are 
          acceptable as input for the parent parameter.</p>
        </dd>
      </di>
      <di>
        <dt>mediaType</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>The "mediaType" attribute indicates that the parent parameter acts as a media type selector 
          for requests or responses. The value of the attribute is the media type that is expected. If
          a representation of an OPTIONAL media type is exposed, this representation can act as a
          template for manipulating a resource.</p>
        </dd>
      </di>
      <di>
        <dt>link</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>The "link" attribute is used to identify links to resources. It can have the value local, remote,
          or list. A local link links to another resource located at the same server entity. A remote link links to 
          a resource located at another server entity anywhere in the XMPP network overlay. A link with a
          list value indicates a list of remote links that can be used for discovery or linking to a set
          of resources.</p>
        </dd>
      </di>
    </dl>
  </section2>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Resource Access' anchor='restaccess'>
  <p>In order to access a resource, the &IQ; stanza type "set" has to be used. The returned 
  &IQ; stanza is either of type "error" or "result". If it is of type "result", the returned content has to be
  complied with the xml-rest schema of this specification. The xml-rest schema has been designed 
  for providing a xml-rest encoded payload for accessing a resource. 
  An &IQ; stanza MUST NOT contain more than one method element with one request and one response.
  The following example illustrates how the create method of the previous example is requested. 
  Here, the client requests three VMs which are based on an image that is available as resource 
  on the client's side.</p>

</iq>
      ]]></example>
  <p>In order to make sure that both parties have a common understanding, the requester specifies also
  the expected responds type which has been exposed during the exploration step. The counter party has to
  answer such a request with the same request element and an extended complitation of the response
  element as illustrated in the example below.
