<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>
    In many XMPP applications it is desirable to be able to act anonymously to
    prevent leaking personally identifiable information (PII) to a third party.
    Traditionally this is accomplished using SASL authentication and the
    ANONYMOUS mechanism as detailed in &xep0175;, however, ANONYMOUS auth
    provides no mechanism for changing identities (requesting a new JID) without
    creating a new session, and server operators may not wish to allow anonymous
    authentication to prevent abuse.
  </p>
  <p>
    This specification solves these problems by decoupling anonymous identity
    management from authentication.
    This allows logged in users (anonymous or otherwise at the server operators
    disgression) to request a new temporary identifier, a "burner" JID, which
    may be used by its owner in any context where they would normally use their
    persistent primary JID.

<section1 topic='Requirements' anchor='reqs'>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A server or service is able to issue a unique ephemeral identity to a user
      that supplies the server or service with a public key.
    </li>
    <li>
      A user is able to generate any number of burner JIDs from using their
      private key which can be verified against their ephemeral identity on the
      server.
    </li>
  </ul>

      <dt>Burner JID</dt>
      <dd>
        A temporary JID that is not valid for the purpose of authentication but
        which may be used in place of the authentication identity in a

<section1 topic='Use Cases' anchor='usecases'>
  <ul>
    <li>
      As a user concerned about SPAM I want to join a public chat room
      anonymously to prevent JID harvesting.
    </li>
    <li>
      As the author of a social website I want to allow users to create
      ephemeral identities which can be used to contact them even if they have
      not granted access to their personal information.
    </li>
    <li>
      As a server operator I want to allow users to act anonymously, but also
      want a way to rate limit the creation of ephemeral identities associated
      with a given authentication identity.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Business Rules' anchor='rules'>
  <p>
    The user requests an ephemeral identity from the server or another XMPP
    service by sending an IQ containing an "identity" payload qualified by the
    urn:xmpp:burner:0 namespace.
  </p>
  <example caption='User requests ephemeral identity'><![CDATA[

</iq>]]></example>
  <p>
    If the service wishes to issue an ephemeral identity to the user it replies
    with a new burner JID:

<section1 topic='Determining Support' anchor='support'>
  <p>
    Services that support issuing burner JIDs MUST advertise the fact in
    responses to &xep0030; "disco#info" requests by returning an identity of
    "authz/ephemeral":

<section1 topic='Implementation Notes' anchor='impl'>
  <p>
    It may be impractical to store verification information for every burner JID
    issued by the system.
    To this end it is RECOMMENDED that the localpart of a burner JID be an
    HMAC-SHA-2 which includes the users JID or another unique identifier, an
    expiration or issued time for the burner JID if appropriate, TLS channel
    binding information, session information, or any other data the server
    wishes to verify.
    The format of this key or its input values is left as an implementation
    decision.
    As with persistent JIDs, the client MUST NOT assign any meaning to the
    localpart or resourcepart of a burner JID.
  </p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>
  <p>
    To prevent burner JIDs from being abused for spamming, implementations
    SHOULD rate limit all burner JIDs in use by a given authentication identity
    as a single unit.
  </p>
  <p>
    When a users session ends it is RECOMMENDED that any ephemeral identities
    associated with their session be purged.
  </p>
  <p>
    If TLS channel binding information is encoded in the burner JID it is
    RECOMMENDED that the tls-unique channel binding value be used as defined by
    &rfc5929; &sect;3.
    However, for resumed sessions the JIDs SHOULD be considered invalid unless
    the master-secret fix from &rfc7627; has been implemented because otherwise
    resumption does not include enough context to successfully verify the
    binding.

  <section2 topic='Service Discovery Category/Type' anchor='registrar-disco'>
    <p>
      Upon advancement of this proposal from experimental to draft status the
      &REGISTRAR; will include a category of "authz" in its registry at
      &DISCOCATEGORIES;.
      The registrar will also add a value of "ephemeral" to that category.
      The registry submission is as follows:
    </p>
    <code><![CDATA[
<category>
  <name>authz</name>
  <desc>Services and nodes that provide authorization identities.</desc>
  <type>
    <name>ephemeral</name>
    <desc>
      An authorization service that provides ephemeral "burner" identities.
    </desc>

      Future submissions to the XMPP Registrar may register additional types.
