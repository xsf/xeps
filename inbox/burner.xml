<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>
    In many XMPP applications it is desirable to be able to act anonymously to
    prevent leaking personally identifiable information (PII) to a third party.
    Traditionally this is accomplished using SASL authentication and the
    ANONYMOUS mechanism as detailed in &xep0175;, however, ANONYMOUS auth
    provides no mechanism for changing identities (requesting a new JID) without
    creating a new session, nor does it provide authentication of users.
  </p>
  <p>
    This specification solves these problems by decoupling anonymous identity
    management from authentication.
    This allows logged in users (authenticated or anonymous at the server
    operators disgression) to request a new temporary identifier, a "burner"
    JID, which may be used by its owner to construct a new session with the
    server that is anonymous to third parties but is (optionally) locally
    authenticated.

<section1 topic='Use Cases' anchor='usecases'>
  <ul>
    <li>
      As a user concerned about spam I want to join a public chat room
      anonymously to prevent JID harvesting.
    </li>
    <li>
      As the author of a social website I want to allow users to create
      ephemeral identities which can be used to contact them even if they have
      not granted access to their personal information.
    </li>
    <li>
      As a server operator I want to allow users to act anonymously, but also
      want a way to rate limit the creation of ephemeral identities associated
      with a given authentication identity.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Business Rules' anchor='rules'>
  <p>
    The user requests an ephemeral identity from the server or another XMPP
    service by sending an IQ containing an "identity" payload qualified by the
    urn:xmpp:burner:0 namespace.
  </p>
  <example caption='User requests ephemeral identity'><![CDATA[
<iq from='caiusmarcius@example.net/corioli'
    id='h7ns81g'
    to='example.net'
    type='get'>
  <identity xmlns='urn:xmpp:burner:0'/>
</iq>]]></example>
  <p>
    If the service wishes to issue an ephemeral identity to the user it replies
    with a new burner JID:
  </p>
  <example caption='Server issues burner JID'><![CDATA[
<iq from='example.net'
    id='h7ns81g'
    to='caiusmarcius@example.net/corioli'
    type='result'>
  <identity xmlns='urn:xmpp:burner:0'>
    <jid>
      hfgnINTSA-ciCLz6NhTtCD5Jr0k:1477672278884j@example.net
    </jid>
  </identity>
</iq>]]></example>
  <p>
    The burner JID MUST be a bare JID.
    Burner JIDs are not valid for the purpose of authentication, but may be
    authorized to perform actions.
    To use the burner JID the client then attempts to establish a new session
    with the server using the account that requested the burner JID as the
    authentication identity and the burner JID as the authorization identity as
    defined in &rfc4422; &sect;2. If the server does not support SASL, or does
    not support any SASL mechanisms that support authorization identities,
    burner JIDs cannot be used.
  </p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Determining Support' anchor='support'>
  <p>
    Services that support issuing burner JIDs MUST advertise the fact in
    responses to &xep0030; "disco#info" requests by returning an identity of
    "authz/ephemeral":
  </p>
  <example caption='Service responds to disco#info query'><![CDATA[
<iq type='result'
    from='muc.example.net'
    to='caiusmarcius@example.net/corioli'
    id='k3hs5174'>

<section1 topic='Implementation Notes' anchor='impl'>
  <p>
    It may be impractical to store verification information for every burner JID
    issued by the system.
    To this end servers that implement this specification may choose to encode
    information into the localpart of issued burner JIDs which can be verified
    when a user attempts to authorize a new session to use the burner JID.
    If an implementation chooses to do this it is RECOMMENDED that an
    &nistfips198-1; be used.
    This HMAC MAY include the JID of the associated authentication identity, an
    expiration or issued time for the burner JID, session information, TLS
    channel binding data, or any other information the server wishes to verify.
    The format of this key or its input values is left as an implementation
    decision.
  </p>
  <p>
    As with persistent JIDs, the client MUST NOT assign any meaning to the
    localpart or resourcepart of a burner JID.
  </p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>
  <p>
    To prevent burner JIDs from being abused for spamming, implementations
    SHOULD rate limit all burner JIDs in use by an authentication identity as a
    single unit.
  </p>
  <p>
    If TLS channel binding information is encoded in the burner JID it is
    RECOMMENDED that the tls-unique channel binding value be used as defined by
    &rfc5929; &sect;3.
    However, for resumed sessions the JIDs SHOULD be considered invalid unless
    the master-secret fix from &rfc7627; has been implemented because otherwise
    resumption does not include enough context to successfully verify the
    binding.
  </p>
  <p>
    Implementations that choose to encode information in the localpart of burner
    JIDs should take care when choosing a hash function.
    For current recommendations see &xep0300;.

      Upon advancement of this proposal from experimental to draft status the
      &REGISTRAR; will include a category of "authz" in its registry at
      &DISCOCATEGORIES;.
      The registrar will also add a value of "ephemeral" to that category.
      The registry submission is as follows:
    </p>
    <code><![CDATA[
<category>
  <name>authz</name>
  <desc>Services and nodes that provide authorization identities.</desc>
  <type>
    <name>ephemeral</name>
    <desc>
      An authorization service that provides ephemeral identities.
    </desc>

      Future submissions to the XMPP Registrar may register additional types.
