<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>&xmppcore; specifies the use of _tcp SRV records as the method of discovering how to connect to an XMPP server. This XEP extends that to include _tls SRV records and combine priorities and weights as if they were a single SRV record. Applied to both xmpp-client and xmpp-server SRV records, this provides the opportunity to connect to XMPP servers with at least equal and perhaps increased security and privacy over using STARTTLS. It also provides an easy way for clients to bypass restrictive firewalls that only allow HTTPS, and for servers to host multiple protocols/services on a single port.</p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Requirements' anchor='reqs'>
    <p>The following format for DNS SRV resource records is specified in &rfc2782;:</p>
    <code><![CDATA[
    _service._proto.name. TTL class SRV priority weight port target.
    ]]></code>
    <p><cite>XMPP Core</cite> defines SRV records only where 'proto' is 'tcp'. This document specifies to additionally look up the same records where 'proto' is 'tls'. This document specifies that the following additional rules apply:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Treat both 'tcp' and 'tls' records as the same record with regard to connection order as specified by <cite>RFC 2782</cite>, in that all priorities and weights are mixed. (so the server operator can decide if they would rather clients connect to tcp with STARTTLS or just with TLS directly)</li>
      <li>Where 'proto' is 'tls' the client or server MUST connect with TLS enabled.</li>
      <li>Where 'proto' is 'tcp' the client or server MUST NOT connect with TLS enabled, connection method is unchanged from <cite>XMPP Core</cite>.</li>
      <li>TLS certificates MUST be validated the same way as for STARTTLS. (ie, as specified in <cite>XMPP Core</cite>).</li>
      <li>STARTTLS MUST NOT be used over TLS connections.</li>
      <li>Client or server SHOULD set SNI TLS extension to the host in the SRV record.</li>
      <li>Client or server SHOULD set the ALPN (&rfc7301;) TLS extension.</li>
      <li>When ALPN is used protocol MUST be 'xmpp-client' where 'xmpp-client' is the SRV 'service'.</li>
      <li>When ALPN is used protocol MUST be 'xmpp-server' where 'xmpp-server' is the SRV 'service'.</li>
    </ol>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Use Cases' anchor='usecases'>
  <p>For server operators, this provides a way to host multiple services on the same port, especially when SNI or ALPN extensions are used. Servers could even host xmpp-client and xmpp-server services on the same TLS port. For clients, this provides a virtually no overhead way to bypass restrictive firewalls that only allow HTTP over port 80 and HTTPS over port 443, as xmpp-over-tls is indistinguishable from http-over-tls.</p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Implementation Notes' anchor='impl'>
  <p>The only overhead is the single additional SRV lookup. All clients that support STARTTLS already have support for TLS-over-tcp. </p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>
    <p>TLS provides AT LEAST the same level of security as STARTTLS, and possibly more privacy as using STARTTLS leaks that the underlying protocol is XMPP, while any TLS stream should be indistinguishable from any other TLS stream.  All security setup and certificate validation code should be shared between the STARTTLS and TLS logic as well.</p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='IANA Considerations' anchor='iana'>
	<p>ALPN (<cite>RFC 7301</cite>) requires registration of the new Protocol IDs, 'xmpp-client' and 'xmpp-server', specified in this document.  The registry is currently located <link url='https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-extensiontype-values/tls-extensiontype-values.xhtml#alpn-protocol-ids'>here</link></p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='XMPP Registrar Considerations' anchor='registrar'>
  <p>There are no XMPP Registrar Considerations.</p>
