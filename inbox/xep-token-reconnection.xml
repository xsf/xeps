<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>While reconnecting to the XMPP server the client usually has to go again through the long proces for SASL challeng response exchange which may lead to noticably long time to finish the authenitcation, especially while using SCRAM based mechanisms. This extenstion attempts to simplify reconnection by using tokens obtained from the XMPP server</p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Requirements' anchor='reqs'>
  <p>This extension requires the client application to authenticate to the XMPP server using regular XMPP authentication mechanism like SCRAM-SHA-1, DIGEST-MD5 at least once. After that, following authentications maybe done using X-OAUTH SASL mechanism and only token obtained from the server.</p>

  <section2 topic="Token types" anchor="token_types">
    <table caption="Token types">
      <tr><th>Token Type</th><th>Description</th></tr>
      <tr><td>Access token</td><td>These are short lived tokens whose grants aren't
  tracked by the server (i.e. there's no need to store anything in a database).
  Access tokens can be used as a payload for the X-OAUTH authentication mechanism
  and grant access to the system.
  Access tokens can't be revoked.
  Access token is valid only until its expiry date is reached.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Refresh token</td><td>These are longer lived tokens which are tracked by the server,
  therefore require persistent storage (as of now only PostgreSQL is supported).
  Refresh tokens can be used as a payload for the X-OAUTH authentication mechanism
  and grant access to the system, as well as result in a new pair of tokens</td></tr>

  <section2 topic="Token format" anchor="token_formats">
    <p>All tokens are to be exchanged as Base64 encoded binary data. Serialization format of the token before encoding with Base64 is dependent on its type. Common parts in every token are BARE_JID and EXPIRES_AT. EXPIRES_AT is a timestamp saying when given token will expire.</p>

      <code>
BASE64_encode
