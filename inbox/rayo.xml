  <title>Rayo</title>
  <abstract>This specification defines an XMPP protocol extension for the third-party control of telephone calls and other similar media sessions. The protocol includes support for session management/signaling, as well as advanced media resources such as speech recognizers, speech synthesizers and audio/video recorders. The protocol serves a different purpose from that of first-party protocols such as Jingle or SIP, and is compatible with those protocols.</abstract>

<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>Rayo is a protocol to allow third-party remote control over media sessions, audio/video mixers and a variety of advanced media resources such as speech recognizers, speech synthesizers and audio/video recorders. These capabilities can be combined to create a wide variety of applications such as menu-based phone systems, in-game conferencing and anonymous dating services. Unlike <a href='xep-0166.html'>Jingle</a> or even <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol'>SIP</a>, a Rayo client is not concerned with being a party to either the session negotiation or the media stream itself.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A Rayo server takes on the role of negotiating a media session between itself and some other endpoint, or between two external endpoints, by way of an implementation-specific means, be that Jingle, SIP, the public-switched telephone network, or anything else. The server may even bridge multiple networks.</li>
    <li>The server then presents the Rayo protocol as an interface to a Rayo client, allowing it to monitor and/or exercise third-party control over particular the established media sessions.</li>
    <li>The client has the option to accept/reject/answer inbound session requests, request the creation of outbound sessions and monitor their progress, execute media operations such as speech synthesis, speech recognition &amp; recording, and to end sessions.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The relationship between the calling parties, the Rayo server and the Rayo client looks something like this:</p>
  <code>
    [caller] ----SIP---- [rayo server] ( -----Jingle---- [callee] ) optional
                              |
                              |
                          rayo client
  </code>

  <p>This document defines the core Rayo protocol, and contains provisions for its extension by further specifications.</p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='How it works' anchor='howitworks'>
  <p>In order to understand the nature of a Rayo interaction, here we show a simple example of a control session.</p>

  <example caption="New call announces itself to a potential controlling party"><![CDATA[
<presence from='9f00061@call.shakespeare.lit'
          to='juliet@capulet.lit/balcony'>
  <c xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/caps'
     hash='sha-1'
     node='urn:xmpp:rayo:call:1'
     ver='QgayPKawpkPSDYmwT/WM94uAlu0='/>
  <offer xmlns='urn:xmpp:rayo:1'
         to='tel:+18003211212'
         from='tel:+13058881212'/>
</presence>
]]></example>

  <p>In this example, a call from 'tel:+13058881212' has reached the Rayo server 'shakespeare.lit' by calling 'tel:+18003211212', and been assigned an ID '9f00061'. The server has determined that 'juliet@capulet.lit' is a valid candidate for delegating control of the call, and so has directed an <a href='def-offer'>offer event</a> to her 'balcony' resource.</p>

  <p>The client then decides that it is able to handle the incoming call, and so accepts it from the server, thus gaining exclusive control and indicating to the calling party that the call will be processed and that it should ring.</p>

  <example caption="Potential controlling party attempts to become definitive controlling party by sending the call an accept command"><![CDATA[
<iq from='juliet@capulet.lit/balcony'
    to='9f00061@call.shakespeare.lit'
    type='set'
    id='hd721'>
  <accept xmlns='urn:xmpp:rayo:1'/>
</iq>
]]></example>

  <example caption="Call acknowledges accept command to the (now) definitive controlling party"><![CDATA[
<iq from='9f00061@call.shakespeare.lit'
    to='juliet@capulet.lit/balcony'
    type='result'
    id='hd721'/>
]]></example>

  <p>Following confirmation from the server that the attempt to gain control of the call was successful, the client proceeds to answer the call, opening up the media stream between the caller and the server.</p>

  <example caption="Controlling party answers the call"><![CDATA[
<iq from='juliet@capulet.lit/balcony'
    to='9f00061@call.shakespeare.lit'
    type='set'
    id='43jo3'>
  <answer xmlns='urn:xmpp:rayo:1'/>
</iq>
]]></example>

  <example caption="Call acknowledges answer command to controlling party"><![CDATA[
<iq from='9f00061@call.shakespeare.lit'
    to='juliet@capulet.lit/balcony'
    type='result'
    id='43jo3'/>
]]></example>

  <p>Once the client has confirmation that the call has been answered, it triggers the start of a media output component in order to play a message to the caller using a Text-to-speech (TTS) engine.</p>

  <example caption="Controlling party requests a new output component"><![CDATA[
<iq from='juliet@capulet.lit/balcony'
    to='9f00061@call.shakespeare.lit'
    type='set'
    id='j9d3j'>
  <output xmlns='urn:xmpp:rayo:output:1'
          voice='allison'>
    <document content-type="text/plain">
      <![CDATA[
        You have no new messages. Goodbye!
      ]]]]><![CDATA[>
    </document>
  </output>
</iq>
]]></example>

  <example caption="Call acknowledges request for new output component and provides its ID"><![CDATA[
<iq from='9f00061@call.shakespeare.lit'
    to='juliet@capulet.lit/balcony'
    type='result'
    id='j9d3j'>
  <ref xmlns='urn:xmpp:rayo:1' id='fgh4590'/>
</iq>
]]></example>

  <p>After confirmation that the output component was successfully created, the client then awaits notification of its completion.</p>

  <example caption="Output component announces its completion, giving the reason"><![CDATA[
<presence from='9f00061@call.shakespeare.lit/fgh4590'
          to='juliet@capulet.lit/balcony'
          type='unavailable'>
 <complete xmlns='urn:xmpp:rayo:ext:1'>
   <finish xmlns='urn:xmpp:rayo:output:complete:1' />
 </complete>
</presence>
]]></example>

  <p>The client then decides it has no further operations to perform on the call, and that the call should end. It instructs the server to hang up the call gracefully.</p>

  <example caption="Controlling party hangs up the call"><![CDATA[
<iq from='juliet@capulet.lit/balcony'
    to='9f00061@call.shakespeare.lit'
    type='set'

<section1 topic='Requirements' anchor='reqs'>
  <p>The protocol defined herein is designed to provide the following features:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Call Control:</strong> Incoming calls are "offered" to clients at which point they can be answered, rejected, redirected to another destination, etc. Outbound calls may also be made and monitored. Every attempt is made to be shield the Rayo client from the low level telephony protocol (e.g. SIP, Jingle, PSTN, etc).</li>
    <li><strong>Audio File Playback:</strong> A compatible Rayo server will fetch a file from a a specified URL and play the containing audio to the caller.</li>
    <li><strong>Speech Synthesis / TTS:</strong> In cases where dynamic data must be spoken, a Speech Synthesis engine may be used to play computer generated speech to the caller.</li>
    <li><strong>Touch-tone Events / DTMF:</strong> Rayo surfaces real-time event when the caller presses keys on their touch-tone keypad.</li>
    <li><strong>Speech Recognition:</strong> Enables the phone application to take spoken queues allowing for sophisticated voice-driven menus and directory services.</li>
    <li><strong>Call Recording:</strong> Can be used to capture the caller's voice (e.g. Voicemail) or both sides of the call for auditing and compliance purposes.</li>
    <li><strong>Mixing:</strong> Typically referred to as an audio "conference"; calls can be joined together so that the participants can hear each other in real-time.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Many third-party call control protocols have preceeded Rayo (see Asterisk's AGI/AMI, FreeSWITCH's eventsocket, Microsoft's TAPI, Java's JTAPI, Novell/AT&amp;T's TSAPI, CSTA, etc). None of these protocols is ideal, and all have one or more of the following drawbacks:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Totally ground-up wire protocol</strong> requiring implementation all the way down to the socket.</li>
    <li><strong>Platform/vendor/hardware specific</strong> - each system implements its own proprietary protocol (in many cases, without a formal published specification) which does not allow easily porting an application from one back-end to another.</li>
    <li><strong>Synchronous interface</strong> - Operations on calls or other entities are often blocking, and one must serialise all control messages.</li>
    <li><strong>Inconsistent</strong> - evolved, rather than designed.</li>
    <li><strong>Lacking in scalability</strong> - client/server sometimes tied one-to-one, servers rarely clustered, advanced message routing not possible.</li>
    <li><strong>Poor security</strong> - lack of wire-level encryption, lack of or sub-standard authentication mechanisms, lack of or limited authorization mechanisms, lack of or poor sandboxing between multiple tenants on one system.</li>
    <li><strong>Inextensible</strong> - The specification of extensions to the core protocol is either impossible or very difficult.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Rayo has been designed with these failings in mind, and intends to address many concerns not addressed by these earlier attempts. The following considerations were made:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Simple client library implementation</strong> - XMPP client libraries exist in all modern languages, and many are of a high standard of quality and maturity.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-platform standard</strong> - The protocol must not expose any platform specifics and all elements should be candidates for implementation on any suitable platform. Addiditionally, the protocol must be ratified as a standard following a community discussion.</li>
    <li><strong>Asynchronous interface</strong> - The protocol should present an asynchronous interface for the purposes of performance and flexibility in performing parallel operations.</li>
    <li><strong>Consistent</strong> - The protocol must provide a considered, unobtrusive, logically and philisophically consistent interface.</li>
    <li><strong>Federated</strong> - The protocol must support communication between client and server entities on separately owned, operated and addressed networks.</li>
    <li><strong>Flexible routing</strong> - The protocol must lend itself to routing across wide networks such as the internet, and to potential complex routing such as proxying or redirection. Additionally, the client and server should each be aware of the presence of the other and be able to use such information to make routing decisions.</li>
    <li><strong>Extensible</strong> - The protocol must provide for the possibility of extra functionality being added by future specifications or an individual implementation.</li>
    <li><strong>Secure</strong> - The protocol should include appropriate measures for authentication and authorization of participants, as well as preventing third-parties from intercepting control messages.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Many of the features in the above list are available to Rayo at no specification or implementation cost, since they are core to XMPP itself and thus Rayo inherits these 'for free'.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the protocol is required to abstract away the complexity of the back-end negotiation, especially the details of the transport protocols such as SIP or Jingle, but to map conceptually to such protocols.</p>

<section1 topic='Concepts and Approach' anchor='concepts'>
  <p>A complete Rayo deployment has several elements and interacting entities which must be understood.</p>

  <section2 topic='Actors' anchor='concepts-actors'>
    <section3 topic='Server' anchor='concepts-actors-server'>
      <p>A Rayo server is an entity which is capable of receiving and intiating calls and being party to their media stream, while exposing a Rayo interface to a client in order to permit control over its calls. The Rayo server may handle calls in any way supported by the implementation, such as SIP, Jingle, etc, and should expose a full XMPP domain at the root level of the service deployment (eg shakespeare.lit).</p>
      <p>The Rayo server is responsible for keeping track of valid clients, routing calls to the correct potential controlling parties, performing authorization measures on received stanzas, etc.</p>
      <p>For the purposes of this specification, complex server-side deployments such as clusters, proxies, gateways, protocol translators, etc are not considered. Further details of such concepts may be found in their (present or future) relevant specifications.</p>
    </section3>
    <section3 topic='Client(s)' anchor='concepts-actors-client'>
      <p>A Rayo client is an entity which implements the Rayo protocol for the purpose of asserting control over calls made available by a Rayo server. The method by which such control measures are determined is outside the scope of this document, but may be the result of human interaction or some automated decision-making process.</p>
      <p>A Rayo client is responsible for indicating its availability to a Rayo server and responding to offer messages appropriately.</p>
    </section3>
    <section3 topic='Calls' anchor='concepts-actors-calls'>
      <p>A Rayo call is a short-lived XMPP entity within the scope of the deployment's root domain, perhaps at a sub-domain, with the purpose of representing a single session. It is usually a simple alias for the main server process.</p>
      <p>A Rayo call is the entity with which most client interactions are made, and is responsible for sending its events to and receiving commands from a client. Calls may host components.</p>
      <p>Calls have separate presence from the root domain of the service and thus appear to be separate entities.</p>
    </section3>
    <section3 topic='Mixers' anchor='concepts-actors-mixers'>
      <p>A Rayo mixer is an XMPP entity within the scope of the deployment's root domain, perhaps at a sub-domain, with the purpose of representing a service for the linking of media streams from several calls. It is usually a simple alias for the main server process.</p>
      <p>A Rayo mixer is responsible for sending its events to and receiving commands from one or more clients, and can host components.</p>
      <p>Mixers have separate presence from the root domain of the service and its calls and thus appear to be separate entities.</p>
    </section3>
    <section3 topic='Commands' anchor='concepts-actors-commands'>
      <p>A Rayo command is a simple combination of request and response and may be issued directly to the service domain, or to a call or a mixer. Commands are executed serially and are generally very short-lived.</p>
    </section3>
    <section3 topic='Components' anchor='concepts-actors-components'>
      <p>Components extend the Rayo protocol by providing additional media and call control functionality.</p>

      <p>Components have a lifecycle and are started by sending a specialized command to a call or mixer. Thus, a request for creation of a component will return a reference to the component's ID, and the component will continue to execute until it completes, potentially sending events and processing commands along the way (such as an instruction to pause or terminate), before finally issuing an event indicating its completion and thus unavailability. Multiple components may be active on a call or mixer at any one time, and commands may be executed on any entity during the execution of a component.</p>
    </section3>
  </section2>

  <section2 topic="Addressing Scheme" anchor='addressing'>
    <p>All of the actors described in the previous section (with the exception of commands) are represented by XMPP entities with a JID of their own. Thus, a scheme for determining the JIDs of each of these entities is required. The following is the required naming scheme for Rayo deployments, where elements in square brackets are optional.</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Actor</th>

    </table>
    <p>Commands should be addressed to the entity on which they should be enacted. Individual commands only apply to certain object (for example instructing a component to hangup will return an error). In general, commands may be sent from a client to the service, a call, a mixer or a component. Events may be sent from a call, a mixer or a component to a client.</p>
  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Delivery Mechanism' anchor='concepts-delivery'>
    <p>Rayo defines several events and commands which may be executed on one of the above actors. These payloads must be sent within an XMPP primitive element, and the rules are as such:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Events:</strong> Sent as directed presence from the entity producing the event to a client.</li>
      <li><strong>Commands:</strong> Sent as an &lt;iq/&gt; with the 'type' attribute 'set' from the client to the entity to be acted on. Responses returned as an &lt;iq/&gt; with the 'type' attribute either 'result' or 'error'.</li>
    </ul>

</section1>
<section1 topic='Session Flow' anchor='session'>
  <p>This section describes the form, function and order of Rayo stanzas sent across the wire, and the circumstances in which they apply and/or may arise.</p>

  <section2 topic='Client Registration' anchor='session-registration'>
    <p>In order for a Rayo client to be considered a potential controlling party for incoming sessions, it MUST first notify the Rayo server that it is available for the receipt of calls. This is done by sending directed presence to the Rayo server with a &lt;show/&gt; element containing 'chat' as in the example:</p>
    <example caption="Client presents itself as available to the Rayo server"><![CDATA[
<presence from='juliet@capulet.lit/balcony'
          to='shakespeare.lit'>
  <c xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/caps'
     hash='sha-1'

     ver='QgayPKawpkPSDYmwT/WM94uAlu0='/>
 <show>chat</show>
</presence>
]]></example>

    <p>Conversely, when a Rayo client wishes not to be considered a potential controlling party, it SHOULD send directed presence to the Rayo server with a &lt;show/&gt; element containing 'dnd' as in the example:</p>
    <example caption="Client presents itself as unavailable to the Rayo server"><![CDATA[
<presence from='juliet@capulet.lit/balcony'
          to='shakespeare.lit'>

  <section2 topic='Session Establishment' anchor='session-establishment'>
    <p>Sessions may be established either at the request of the Rayo client (an outbound call) or as a result of a 3rd party request (an inbound call). Each scenario differs in the Rayo protocol only up to the point at which the session is established and media begins to flow. First we shall examine the sequence of stanzas passed between server and client in each of these scenarios.</p>

    <section3 topic='Outbound Call' anchor='session-establishment-outbound'>
      <p>In order for a client to establish a new outbound call, it MUST first send a <link url="def-dial">dial command</link> to the server, indicating the proposed target for the call, its apparent source, and any meta-data to send to the target as headers.</p>

      <example caption="Client requests establishment of a new outbound session"><![CDATA[

    <header name="x-skill" value="agent" />
    <header name="x-customer-id" value="8877" />
  </dial>
</iq>
      ]]></example>

      <p>On successfully receiving and parsing the dial command, the server SHOULD perform its own proprietary authorization measures to ensure that only desirable outbound sessions are created. If it is established that the command should not be allowed, the server MUST return an error giving an authorization reason.</p>

      <section4 topic='Errors' anchor='session-establishment-outbound-errors'>
        <p>There are several reasons why the server might immediately return an error instead of acknowledging the creation of a new call:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The client is unknown to the server and the server does not permit session creation by unknown clients.</li>
          <li>The client is not authorized to create this new session.</li>
          <li>The server does not support outbound calls.</li>
          <li>The server does not have sufficient resources to create a new session.</li>

      <p>If the command is successful and the call is queued, however, confirmation of such should be sent to the client, including a reference to the unique ID of the call. This call ID may be used to execute commands and filter events for the duration of the session.</p>

      <p>Once the server receives notification that the session has been accepted by the third party, it should send a ringing event to the client to indicate such:</p>

      <p>Similarly, once the server receives notification that the session has been answered, it should negotiate media between the dialed party and its local media server. Once media negotiation is complete, it should send an answered event to the client to indicate such:</p>

        <p>In this case, the server MUST treat the session creation in the same way as without the join element, until the point of media negotiation. Here, the server should negotiate media as specified by the join element, in accordance with the rules defined in <link url='#session-joining'>joining calls</link>. Media MUST NOT be negotiated with the local media server, unless the join specifies so. The join operation MUST behave as described in <link url='#session-joining'>joining calls</link>.</p>
      </section4>
    </section3>

    <section3 topic='Inbound Call' anchor='session-establishment-inbound'>
      <p>When the system receives a call from one of its connected networks, it MUST then expose that requested session to Rayo clients. It SHOULD use an implementation-specific routing mechanism to map incoming calls to some set of registered JIDs which are considered appropriate controlling parties. From this set, it SHOULD then remove any parties whom it can identify as being temporarily inappropriate for control (either unavailable based on presence, under too much load, or any other metric which the server has available). If, as a result, the set of Potentially Controlling Parties is empty, the server MUST reject the call with a 'decline' reason.</p>

      <p>If the server can identify active Potential Controlling Parties, it MUST offer them control of the call simultaneously. The server must broadcast an offer on behalf of the call to all Potential Controlling Parties, using applicable to/from/header data from the incoming session. The server MUST also include entity capabilities information in the presence stanza containing the offer, in order to advertise the fact that the entity is a call, qualified by the node name "urn:xmpp:rayo:call:1".</p>

      <p>Once the server has offered control, it MUST wait indefinitely for a response from a PCP. The server SHOULD monitor the availability of PCPs to whom offers have been sent. If they all cease to be PCPs (eg by going offline) then the call should be rejected in the same way as if there had not been any available PCPs to begin with.</p>

      <p>If an offered PCP executes a command against the call, by sending a command node to the call's JID inside an IQ 'set', the server should execute the following routine:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>If the call does not have a DCP, set it to the PCP from which the command originated.</li>
        <li>If the call has a DCP, and the command did not originate from the DCP, return a conflict (cancel) error in response to the command of the following format:

  <section2 topic='Joining Calls' anchor='session-joining'>
    <p>Calls in a Rayo system are capable of having their media streams moved/manipulated. Once such manipulation is to join the media streams of two calls. In a scenario where callA and callB should be joined, the client MUST send a join command to either call (not both) specifying the call ID of the other call, like so:</p>
    <example caption="Client instructs callA to join to callB and the server acknowledges the join was completed"><![CDATA[
<iq from='juliet@capulet.lit/balcony'

    <p>If the calls to be joined to each other are in the same security zone, the server MUST join the media streams of the two calls and return an empty IQ result to confirm that the operation has been successful. If the parties to be joined are not within the same security zone, an error should be returned as detailed below.</p>

    <p>When calls are joined to each other by any mechanism, each call MUST dispatch a joined event specifying who they have been joined to:</p>
    <example caption="Call A and B were joined, both calls emit joined events"><![CDATA[

    <p>By default, the server MUST join the calls by bridging their audio through its local media server, with bidirectional media. In order to specify alternative behaviour, the client MAY specify a media option (either 'bridge' or 'direct') and/or a direction option (either 'duplex', 'send' or 'recv'), and the server MUST bridge accordingly.</p>

  <section2 topic='Mixers' anchor='session-mixers'>
    <p>While calls may generally be joined peer-to-peer in any desirable combination, such an implementation is not necessarily scalable or practical to manage. Rayo, therefore, includes the concept of mixers, which are entities like calls, to which calls or other mixers may be joined in the same way as joining multiple calls directly. A mixer MUST be implicitly created the first time a call attempts to join it, MUST immediately broadcast presence to all controlling parties who have calls joined to it, and must respond to the join command with a reference to the mixer. The server MUST include entity capabilities information in the first presence stanza it sends, in order to advertise the fact that the entity is a mixer, qualified by the node name "urn:xmpp:rayo:mixer:1". A mixer MUST emit events (joined, unjoined) to all controlling parties who have calls joined to it, using the same semantics as joining calls.</p>

    <p>In order to support friendly-named mixers without causing naming collisions between security zones, a server SHOULD represent a mixer internally using some alternative name scoped to the client's security zone and mapped to the friendly name/URI presented to the client for the emission of events and processing of commands. A server MUST NOT allow clients to interact with mixers allocated within other security zones either by observing their status or media.</p>

    <p>Mixers MUST respect the normal rules of XMPP presence subscriptions. If a client sends directed presence to a mixer, the mixer MUST implicitly create a presence subscription for the client. On receiving unavailable presence, the mixer MUST stop sending events to the client.</p>

    <p>The error conditions on joining a mixer are the same as for calls, as are the unjoin and join modification semantics. Additionally, mixers SHOULD be able to host components just like calls, following the rules defined for each component.</p>

  <p>Once the last participant unjoins from the mixer, the mixer SHOULD be destroyed. When a mixer is destroyed, it MUST send unavailable presence to all entities which have a presence subscription.</p>

  <section2 topic='Component Execution' anchor='session-component-execution'>
    <p>Components are long-lived elements of a call or mixer which may execute in parallel, have a lifecycle (may send events and/or process commands during their execution, indicate their completion asynchronously) and typically implement media operations. A server SHOULD implement components in such a way that it is acceptable to execute multiple components of the same type or of differing types simultaneously. A server SHOULD implement all core components.</p>

    <p>In the event that a call or mixer receives a command which triggers the execution of a component, it MUST use the normal command handling routine, schedule the component for immediate execution and return a reference to the requesting client as confirmation of the component's creation:</p>

    <p>If a component execution command is received prior to the call being answered, the server MUST NOT answer the call, and SHOULD attempt to use early-media techniques to perform the relevant operation without answering the call. If such early-media is not possible, it MUST return an error indicating that the call state is incorrect (unexpected-request).</p>

    <p>The whole command MUST be parsed up-front, and any applicable validation performed before acknowledgement of the command.</p>

    <section3 topic='Initial Errors' anchor='session-component-initial-errors'>

    <p>Once acknowleged, the component MUST begin execution according to its particular specification.

    <p>During execution, the component MUST respond to commands addressed to it. Each component has its own set of commands, but all components have the 'stop' command in common.

  <p>In order for an application to determine whether an entity supports this protocol, where possible it SHOULD use the dynamic, presence-based profile of service discovery defined in &xep0115;. However, if an application has not received entity capabilities information from an entity, it SHOULD use explicit service discovery instead.</p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Extending Rayo' anchor='extensions'>
  <p>Rayo is a protocol designed for extensibility. Rayo implementations and deployments have great flexibility in the way they map the Rayo protocol to their underlying transport and media layers, and the functionality they provide around the Rayo interface to the system.</p>

  <p>Further commands and components may also be added to the Rayo protocol in order to extend its capabilities. Such extensions should be submitted to the XSF as ProtoXEPs and use namespaces aligning with the core component namespaces.</p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Implementation Notes' anchor='impl'>
  <p>A server MUST document any cases where its behaviour differs from that in this specification (such as lack of support for particular options/components/etc) and return an error whenever a command is not understood. A server MUST NOT silently ignore any instructions.</p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>
  <section2 topic='Denial of Service' anchor='security-dos'>
    <p>Rayo sessions can be resource-intensive. Therefore, it is possible to launch a denial-of-service attack against an entity by burdening it with too many Rayo sessions. Care must be taken to accept sessions only from known entities and only if the entity's device is able to process such sessions.</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Communication Through Gateways' anchor='security-gateways'>
    <p>Rayo communications can be enabled through gateways to non-XMPP networks, whose security characteristics can be quite different from those of XMPP networks. For example, on some SIP networks authentication is optional and "from" addresses can be easily forged. Care must be taken in communicating through such gateways.</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Information Exposure' anchor='security-info'>
    <p>Mere negotiation of a Rayo session can expose sensitive information about the parties (e.g. IP addresses). Care must be taken in communicating such information, and end-to-end encryption should be used if the parties do not trust the intermediate servers or gateways.</p>

  Prior to the development of the Rayo protocol, the most widely-used 3PCC protocols were Asterisk's AGI and AMI. Unfortunately, these protocols have many drawbacks, not least in their inconsistency and relatively poor documentation, but also in that they are poorly secured and lacking in attributes required for significant scalability. Much 3PCC activity is also done using process-internal APIs rather than a wire protocol like XMPP.

  <p>Rayo was developed to satisfy three main desires:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To separate the application logic from the back-end call processing infrastructure for large-scale scripting-based hosted voice application platforms. This helps to ensure that the performance of the back-end infrastructure cannot be impacted by the applications controling it, and specifically to allow sandboxing the applications.</li>
    <li>To create a platform-agnostic protocol for the control of live media sessions that has been designed from the start for such use.</li>
    <li>To enable authenticated, federated, web-scale 3PCC on platforms with APIs only suitable for trusted internal use (Asterisk, FreeSWITCH, etc).</li>
  </ul>

  Initial development of the Rayo specification and its reference implementation was sponsored by Voxeo Labs and Telefónica, with Punchblock being the first client library implementation, as part of the Adhearsion project. Since the beginning of the development process, further implementation efforts have begun on top of Asterisk's AGI/AMI protocols and FreeSWITCH EventSocket, native to FreeSWITCH (mod_rayo), as well as client library implementations in Node/CoffeeScript and Python.
