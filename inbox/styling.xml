<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>
    Historically, XMPP has had no system for simple text styling.
    Instead, specifications like &xep0071; that require full layout engines have
    been used, leading to numerous security issues with implementations.
    Some clients have also performed their own formatting based on identifiers
    in the body.
    While this has worked well for those clients, it is not interoperable and
    leads to clients each supporting their own informal styling languages.
  </p>
  <p>
    This specification aims to provide a single, interoperable text styling
    language that can be used by entities that do not require full layout
    engines.
  </p>

  <section2 topic='Explicit Discovery' anchor='discovery-explicit'>
    <p>
      If an entity supports this specification it MUST advertise the fact by
      returning a feature of 'urn:xmpp:styling:0' &VNOTE; in response to a
      &xep0030; information request (or by advertising this namespace in the
      dynamic profile of service discovery defined in &xep0115;).

  <section2 topic='Implicit Discovery' anchor='discovery-implicit'>
    <p>
      An entity supporting this specification SHOULD render all messages
      &lt;body&gt; elements using this specification and MAY choose to send
      messages formatted using this specification even if the other end has not
      advertised support.
    </p>

<section1 topic='Business Rules' anchor='rules'>
  <section2 topic='Display' anchor='display'>
    <p>
      Formatting characters MAY be displayed styled along with the span they
      apply to or they may be hidden and the styling only applied to the span.
      For instance, given the string "*emphasis*" both of the following are
      valid renderings:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>*emphasis*</strong></li>
      <li><strong>emphasis</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Examples in this document will display the formatting characters for
      clarity.
    </p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Inlines' anchor='emph'>
    <p>
      Inline styling directives are evaluated lazily from the start of the byte
      stream (the left in left-to-right languages and the right in right-to-left
      languages).
      Matches MUST NOT extend over newlines and MUST start with a whitespace
      character or be the beginning of the line or the byte stream.
      Matches MUST contain some text between the two styling directives.
      Inline styling directives may also be doubled to allow the single
      character version of the directive to be styled.
      That is to say, "**emphasis**" is rendered the same as "*emphasis*".
      For example, the word "emphasized" would be styled in each of the
      following messages:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>*emphasized*</strong></li>
      <li>foo <strong>*emphasized*</strong> bar</li>
      <li><strong>*emphasized*</strong>foo<strong>*emphasized*</strong></li>
      <li><strong>*emphasized*</strong>foo*</li>
      <li><strong>**emphasi*zed**</strong> foo*</li>
      <li>* <strong>*emphasized*</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Nothing would be formatted in the following messages (where / represents a
      new line):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>not emphasized*</li>
      <li>*not emphasized</li>
      <li>*not / emphasized*</li>
      <li>**</li>
      <li>****</li>
    </ul>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Order of Operations' anchor='oporder'>
    <p>
      Block level styling such as preformatted blocks and quotations is always
      handled before inlines such as emphasis and inline preformatted text.
    </p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Bold' anchor='bold'>
    <p>
      Text enclosed by '*' (U+002A ASTERISK) MUST be displayed with a greater
      weight than the surrounding text (bold face).
    </p>
    <example caption='Bold'><![CDATA[
<body>
  The full title is **Twelfth Night, or What You Will** but
  *most* people shorten it.
</body>
]]></example>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Italic' anchor='italic'>
    <p>
      Text enclosed by '_'(U+005F LOW LINE) MUST be displayed in italics.
    </p>
    <example caption='Italic'><![CDATA[
<body>
  The full title is _Twelfth Night, or What You Will_ but
  __most__ people shorten it.
</body>
]]></example>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Strike through' anchor='strike'>
    <p>
      Text enclosed by '~'(U+007E TILDE) MUST be displayed with a horizontal
      line through the middle (strike through).
    </p>
    <example caption='Strike through'><![CDATA[
<body>
  Everyone ~dis~likes cake.

]]></example>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Preformatted Inline Text' anchor='pre-inline'>
    <p>
      Text enclosed by a '`' (U+0060 GRAVE ACCENT) MUST be displayed inline in a
      monospace font.
      Inline formatting directives inside the inline preformatted text are not
      rendered.
      For example, in the following the word "monospace" is valid pre-formatted
      inline text:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>This is <tt>`monospace`</tt></li>
      <li>This is <tt>`*monospace*`</tt></li>
      <li>This is <strong><tt>*`monospace and bold`*</tt></strong></li>
    </ul>
    <example caption='Monospace text'><![CDATA[
<body>
  Wow, I can write in `monospace`, even a literal ``backtick (`)``!
</body>
]]></example>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Preformatted Block Text' anchor='pre-block'>
    <p>
      A block of text surrounded by lines consisting of a sequence of three
      backticks (U+0060 GRAVE ACCENT), "```", is preformatted text and should be
      displayed exactly as it was entered including whitespace.
      No other formatting described in this document should be rendered inside
      a preformatted text block.
    </p>
    <example caption='Preformatted block text'><![CDATA[
<body>
  ```
  (println &quot;Hello, world!&quot;)
  ```

  This should show up as monospaced, preformatted text ⤴
</body>
]]></example>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Quotations' anchor='quote'>
    <p>
      A quotation is indicated by one or more lines with a byte stream beginning
      with a '&gt;' (U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN) immediately followed by a
      whitespace character.
      Inline formatting is rendered inside of quotations.
    </p>
    <example caption='Quotation (LTR)'><![CDATA[
<body>
  &gt; That that is, is.

  Said the old hermit of Prague.

<section1 topic='Implementation Notes' anchor='impl'>
  <p>
    The rules for inline styling form a context free grammar that cannot be
    matched by a regular expression.
    A simple stack based parser is recommended instead.

<section1 topic='Accessibility Considerations' anchor='access'>
  <p>
    When displaying text with formatting, developers should take care to ensure
    sufficient contrast exists between styled and unstyled text so that users
    with vision deficiencies are able to distinguish between the two.
