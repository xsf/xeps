        <p>
            This XEP provides a common framework for sending events over an XMPP network. These events can then be logged in event logs or analyzed by network monitors
            to analyze the status or operation of the network and its participants.
        </p>
        <p>
            The basic principle behind interoperable event logging over XMPP is the definition of a common XML element defining the event. This payload is then sent in
            a normal message stanza (i.e. with <strong>type='normal'</strong>) to the recipient. The recipient in turn, if it understands the payload, can choose to store it in an event log, forward it or
            analyze it accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are various event log packages available, but none yet defined for XMPP or using a well defined and known XML format. Therefore, this document defines
            such an XML format. This format is able to store <link url='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424'>Syslog</link> <note>
                RFC-5424: The Syslog Protocol &lt;<link url='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424'>https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424</link>&gt;
            </note> compliant event information, even though the Syslog event model has been somewhat extended.

            <p>
                The following example shows how to send a simple event using a normal message to an event log. There are only two parameters that are required:
                <strong>message</strong> and <strong>timestamp</strong>. This message will be treated as a <strong>Minor Informational</strong> message by the
                recipient.

            <p>
                Using Event IDs the application can provide a machine understandable classification of the event. Examples could be "Login"-events, "ConnectionProblem"-events, etc.
                It is easier to group, parse or interpret events and their tags if you know what type of event it is. Event IDs are manufacturer specific, and only provide a means
                to more easilly extract subsets of events for processing without having to parse message texts (which should be allowed to be localizable).
            </p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note:</strong> To avoid problems when running applications using different locales, event IDs should never be localized.

        <section2 topic='Objects'>
            <p>
                An event is often linked to an object, i.e. on which object an action was performed, or which object is reporting a condition. The object field permits
                the tagging of objects in a common way. It is later easy to extract all events relating to a specific object by using this attribute.
            </p>
        </section2>
        <section2 topic='Subjects'>
            <p>
                An event is often also linked to a subject, i.e. who or what performed a given action resulting in the event or condition. The subject field permits
                the tagging of subjects in a common way. It is later easy to extract all events relating to a specific subbject by using this attribute.
            </p>
        </section2>
        <section2 topic='Facilities'>
            <p>
                Facility can be either a facility in the network sense or in the system sense. This document does not restrict its use to the possible choices defined by
                other protocols such as Syslog, and leaves it open. However, it is left as a special attribute since it is important in monitoring applications.
            </p>
        </section2>
        <section2 topic='Modules'>
            <p>
                A module is part of a larger software package. Using the module attribute makes it easier to attribute events to specific parts of a distributed
                application and analyze them separately.
            </p>
        </section2>
        <section2 topic='Stack Traces'>
            <p>
                Stack Traces can be important information to developers and correlate events to actual locations in the code that generated the event. This document
                does not specify any particular format for stack traces.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that stack traces can be divided into multiple lines separated by CRLF. It is important to encode such strings correctly to avoid problems in
                XML parsers.
            </p>
        </section2>
        <section2 topic='Tags'>
            <p>
                Any event can have a custom set of tags attached to it. A tag is required to have a name and a value. It can also optionally specify a datatype.
                Data Types are specified using Qualified Names (QNames). If possible, they should adher to the list of
                <link url='http://xmpp.org/registrar/xdv-datatypes.html'>Data Forms Validation Datatypes</link> <note>
                    Data Forms Validation Datatypes &lt;<link url='http://xmpp.org/registrar/xdv-datatypes.html'>http://xmpp.org/registrar/xdv-datatypes.html</link>&gt;
                </note> that is maintained by the XMPP Registrar.
            </p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note:</strong> To avoid problems when running applications using different locales, tag names should never be localized.
			</p>
        </section2>
        <section2 topic='Normalized tables'>
            <p>
                If persisting received events in a database, care should be taken if normalized tables are used for storage of tags names and values, event IDs, objects, subjects, 
                facilities and modules. If this is the case, the receiver should look for types of values that can be incompatible with normalized tables (such as floating point values or numbers
                in general, GUIDs, resource names in JIDs etc.) and replace them with some descriptive text and append the corresponding value in the message text instead. This to avoid problems with indexes in
                databases because of devices implemented by third parties.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is still valid to send such information (like sequence numbers, unique GUIDs, resource names in JIDs etc., measurements, etc.) in tags names and values, but should be avoided in
                event IDs, objects, subjects, facilities and modules, as they can cause problems further down the line.
            </p>

    <section1 topic='Internationalization Considerations' anchor='i18n'>
        <section2 topic='Time Zones'>
            <p>
                All timestamps and dateTime values use the XML data type xs:dateTime to specify values. These values include a date, an optional time and an optional time zone.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> If time zone is not available, it is supposed to be undefined. The recipient of an event message without time zone information
                should assume the sender has the same time zone as the received, if not explicitly configured otherwise on the recipient side.
            </p>
            <p>
                If devices report time zone, this information should be propagated throughout the system. Otherwise, comparing timestamps from different time zones will be impossible.
            </p>
        </section2>
        <section2 topic='xml:lang'>
            <p>
                Event messages SHOULD contain an <strong>xml:lang</strong> attribute on the message stanza to specify the language
                used in message texts, etc. If language information is not available (for instance, if relaying messages not created by the device itself,
                the <strong>xml:lang</strong> attribute can be omitted).
            </p>
        </section2>
    </section1>
    <section1 topic='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>
        <p>
            Even though this document permits zero-configuration of devices to event logs, this might not always be the best option. Event information might be sensitive
            and should not be sent to anybody just because they support the event log feature as defined in this document.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Never</strong> log information that should be handled securely or encrypted, such as passwords.
