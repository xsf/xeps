		<p>The Buddycloud project is a set of independently deployable services, that
			inter-operate to create a rich collaboration service.
		</p>
		<p>Buddycloud Channels build on XMPP's native federation and publish-subscribe
			principles to connect to, and synchronise content with users on local and
			remote domains. Services are designed to interoperate. For example, the Media
			Server, Friend Finder, and content recommendation engine work together to help
			developers build a unified collaboration services for individual and groups
			of users.
		</p>
		<p>This XEP seeks to define how the Buddycloud Channel service currently
			functions. It also seeks stay extensible for accommodate future, undefined
			use cases.
		</p>
	</section2>
	<section2 topic="Buddycloud Channels" anchor="Buddycloud Channels">
		<p>
			Buddycloud channels are a bundle of <cite>XEP-0060</cite> publish-subscribe nodes with
			identical subscribers and permissions presented as a JID-like
			name (example:
			<link url="buddycloud:juliet@capulit.lit">juliet@capulet.lit</link>
			. Content posted into channels is automatically synchronised to the correct
			followers on other Buddycloud domains.

		<p>While the Buddycloud Server is designed to work independently of other
			services but can be enhanced with helper services. Each helper communicates
			with the Buddycloud server and other components using XEP-0114 connections.
			Examples of helper services include: push notifications, media hosting,
			contact matching, content search and channel recommendations.

		<p>Helper services' specifications are covered in separate XEPs.
