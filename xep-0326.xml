        <p>
            Concentrators are devices in sensor networks, concentrating the management of a sub set of devices to one point. They can be small (for example: PLC:s managing a small
            set of sensors and actuators), medium-sized (for example: mid-level concentrators, controlling branches of the network, islands, perhaps using separate communication protocols),
            large (for example: entire sub-systems, perhaps managed by a separate child/partner organization) to massive (for example: The entire top-level system, smart-grid, IoT network).
        </p>
        <p>
            Even though this XEP is generally written and can be used by other implementations not based on sensor networks, much of the requirements used to define this specification
            comes from requirements used in sensor networks and Internet of Things applications and infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
            This specification will define the following aspects of a general concentrator profile, that can handle all different types of concentrators available in sensor network architectures:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A concentrator works with multiple <strong>data sources</strong>. Effective management of data sources and their contents is a vital part of this XEP.
            </li>
            <li>The ability to work with massive quantities of entities.</li>
            <li>Effective synchronization of contents between interested parties.</li>
            <li>Effective ways to interact with entities controlled by the concentrator.</li>
        </ul>

		<p>
			Sensor networks contains many different architectures and use cases. For this reason, the sensor network standards have been divided into multiple XEPs according to the following table:

            <p>
                Even though there are technologies available in forms of XEPs that solve parts of the above mentioned problem, they do not provide sufficient support. The following paragraphs will
                take the time to list why different technologies are not applicable.
            </p>
            <section3 topic='XEP-0060'>
                <p>
                    This XEP defines tree structures for nodes in different data sources. &xep0060; defines a model where a tree structure of nodes is published and users can browse this
                    tree structure. Furthermore, it allows the possibility to publish items on these nodes as well as syndication of this information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This XEP also defines data sources (in a tree structure). These data sources contain nodes. &xep0248; defines a structure called a node collection, a structure that
                    allows the creation of collections containing loosely coupled nodes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even though this document defines tree structures of data, it is not however based on XEP-0060. There are multiple reasons for this:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The structures defined in this specification do not include items to publish for each node.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We want to be able to use XEP-0060 in parallel to this specification, for the purpose of publishing sensor data.
                        More information about this is found in <link url='xep-0000-IoT-PubSub.html'>xep-0000-IoT-PubSub.html</link>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For massive systems (hundreds of thousands, or millions, of nodes behind a concentrator, its vitally important to be able to manage sets of nodes directly
                        (for example: Edit multiple nodes at once). Many of the operations in XEP-0060 only allow for operations of singular nodes. Furthermore, many simple operations
                        require multiple messages per node. This document defines way to operate of sets of nodes simultaneously, as well as ways to perform operations with a smaller
                        number of operations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In this document, nodes have specific functions, controlled by a specific Node Type. Different Node Types have different parameter sets, different options, commands,
                        capabilities, etc. XEP-0060 does not differ between node types. There, nodes are only a structural way to sort data into a tree graph.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In this document, nodes have real-time status, like errors, warnings, etc.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section3>
            <section3 topic='XEP-0248'>
                <p>
                    XEP-0248 defines the concept of node collections and syndication of information from nodes in these collections. But XEP-0248 is not used in this specification.
                    There are multiple reasons:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We want to be able to use XEP-0248 in parallel to this specification, for the purpose of publishing sensor data.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Node IDs are not necessarily unique by themselves in the system. This document defines a uniqueness concept based on a triple of data: (Data Source ID, Cache Type, Node ID). This
                        means that Nodes must have IDs unique within a given Cache Type, within a given data source.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We need to expand on types of events generated from a data source, to make them adhere to the particulars of nodes as defined in this specification.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Data sources own their nodes. XEP-0248 define a loosely coupled structure with references to nodes. In this document, a data source is the owner of all nodes
                        contained in it.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <section3 topic='XEP-0050'>
                <p>
                    &xep0050; defines how ad-hoc commands can be implemented and how clients can use such commands to interact with underlying logic. But XEP-0050 is not used in this specification.
                    There are multiple reasons:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We want to be able to use XEP-0050 for other types of commands, than commands defined in this specification. Generally, XEP-0050 is used to implement
                        system-wide commands.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Commands defined in this specification are context sensitive, i.e. they depend on the type of node and the context of the node on which the act.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It is a requirement to be able to execute commands on sets of nodes directly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Since commands have to be context sensitive, a large concentrator system may have hundreds or thousands of different commands, making it impossible to create
                        context sensitive GUI's using XEP-0050.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Dialog types used for Ad-Hoc-commands are not sufficient. First, dynamic dialogs are required in the general case.
                        (<link url='http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0336.html'>XEP-0326</link> define how to create dynamic forms.) Furthermore, the
                        wizard style type of dialogs used for more complex dialogs in ad-hoc commands, are difficult to automate.

                    are depicted as edges. In abstract terms, it's easier to talk about a Node, rather than list different possible node types (sensors, actuators, meters, devices, gateways, etc.).
                    Each Node has a Node ID. Nodes belong to a data source, and all nodes have a Node Type. Some nodes have a parent node, and some nodes have child nodes. Nodes with the same

                    In physics, precision determines the number of digits of precision. In sensor networks however, this definition is not easily applicable. Instead, precision
                    determines, for example, the number of decimals of precision, or power of precision. Example: 123.200 MWh contains 3 decimals of precision. All entities parsing and
                    delivering field information in sensor networks should always retain the number of decimals in a message.

            To create a complete set of operations supported by all types of concentrators, ranging from PLCs to subsystems to entire systems is very difficult. So, the aim
            of this document is instead to create a very small reduced set of operations, a common denominator, that would allow for basic maintenance and interoperability of
            concentrators of different makes and models and of these varying ranges.

                    This document lists a sequence of commands. Some are very basic, while others are used for managing massive amounts of devices. When developing a small PLC, it might
                    be difficult to motivate the implementation of the more advanced commands. They are simply not necessary for the management of the device. So, clients connecting to
                    the concentrator need a way to learn what operations are available in the concentrator, and as a consequence what operations are not. To do this, the
                    <strong>getCapabilities</strong> command is sent, as is shown in the following example.

                    sequence of nodes that are together last as siblings, none of the nodes move relative to each other.

                <p>
                    Previously described commands can return parameters for a node. But these parameters are for presentational or informational use. If the client wants to edit
                    the parameters of a node, another set of commands must be used. This use case shows how <strong>getNodeParametersForEdit</strong> can be used to edit available
                    parameters for one node.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Note:</strong> When editing parameters for a node, a different set of parameters might be returned compared to the set of parameters available in commands
                    mentioned above. There may be various reasons for this, among other things (but not limited to) user rights, node settings, and parameter type. User rights may restrict the number
                    of parameters the user can access. The node may be configured not to allow editing of certain parameters. Also, some types of parameters may only be available in
                    an edit mode (like long multi-line parameters) and not in a shorter presentation mode.

                    After editing the form, the client uses the <strong>setNodeParametersAfterEdit</strong> command to set the parameters in the node. Note that it is possible to
                    set the same parameters (or a sub-set of the same parameters) to a different node using this command, without the need to get new form parameters. However, after the first
                    successful set operation, any form session used for dynamic validation during edit will not be available on the server anymore and must be ignored by the server.

                <p>
                    Advanced concentrators handling large quantities of nodes may let users edit sets of nodes at once to be practical. This is done by publishing the
                    <strong>getCommonNodeParametersForEdit</strong> command. It will return a form with parameters that are common for all selected nodes. Since nodes
                    may have different node types it is assumed that different nodes have different sets of parameters. But if this command is used, only parameters matching
                    in IDs, descriptions, validation rules, etc., (but not values) will be returned in a form.
                </p>

                    Fields marked with the <strong>notSame</strong> element only present one value, perhaps the value of the first node. However, the field should be clearly
                    marked in any end-user GUI (for example by graying the field), and MUST ONLY be sent back to the server in a set operation if explicitly edited by the end-user.
                    The parameter will be set in all selected nodes in that case. Unedited fields should be treated as if the end-user accepts the different values for the current set of nodes.

                    After editing the form, the client uses the <strong>setCommonNodeParametersAfterEdit</strong> command to set the parameters in the set of nodes. Note that it is possible to
                    set the same parameters (or a sub-set of the same parameters) to a different set of nodes using this command, without the need to get new form parameters. However, after the first
                    successful set operation, any form session used for dynamic validation during edit will not be available on the server any more.

                    and presented as parameters on the node. The purpose of the dynamic state attribute of a node, is to give a dynamic runtime state that has
                    the possibility to change during runtime, which operators must be aware of.

                    There are three types of commands available: <strong>Simple</strong>, <strong>Parameterized</strong> and <strong>Query</strong>. <strong>Simple</strong> commands 
                    take no parameters, and are therefore simpler to execute. <strong>Parameterized</strong> commands require the client to get a set of parameters for the corresponding 
                    command before it can be executed. <strong>Query</strong> commands also require a set of parameters to be executed, but return a response after (or during) execution
                    in an asynchronous fashion. Queries can also be aborted during execution. A Query with an empty parameter set is considered to be a simple query, not requiring a 
                    parameter dialog to be shown.

                    <link url='#queryevents'>query events</link> and the reception of them by a client. A client may thinkt a query is still active when asking
                    to abort it, when the query might actually have been finished and removed on the query side. Therefore, clients should be aware of this
                    when receiving <strong>NotFound</strong> responses from a concentrator, that the query might already have been finished.

                    To execute a parameterized command on a set of nodes, the client first needs to get (and edit) a set of parameters for the common command. Getting a set of parameters for a
                    common parameterized command is done as follows:

                    When executing a command, simple or parameterized, on multiple nodes, it might happen that the command fails on some nodes, but not on others, even though
                    any parameters are validated beforehand. Therefore, the client needs to check any <strong>result</strong> elements in the response, even though the

                    When executing a query on multiple nodes, it might happen that the query is rejected on some nodes, but not on others, even though
                    any parameters are validated beforehand. Therefore, the client needs to check any <strong>result</strong> elements in the response, even though the
                    response code is <strong>OK</strong>.

                    <strong>Note:</strong> The execution of a query is an asynchronous process, with a small delay between the compilation and transmission of
                    <link url='#queryevents'>query events</link> and the reception of them by a client. A client may thinkt a query is still active when asking
                    to abort it, when the query might actually have been finished and removed on the query side. Therefore, clients should be aware of this
                    when receiving <strong>NotFound</strong> responses from a concentrator, that the query might already have been finished. In the case of
                    aborting queries on multiple nodes, servers must ignore nodes where the query has already finished executing.

            <p>
                Query events are sent as a response to executing queries on nodes. They are reported asynchronously from the concentrator to the client executing the query. Each
                event is wrapped in a <strong>queryProgress</strong> element within a message sent from the concentrator to the client. Each such <strong>queryProgress</strong>
                element can include any number of query events, and the client must process them in the order they appear in the message.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each <strong>queryProgress</strong> element contains a <strong>queryId</strong> attribute identifying the query to which the events correspond. They also contain
                <strong>sourceId</strong>, <strong>nodeId</strong> and an optional <strong>cacheType</strong> to identify from which node in a concentrator the events originated.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> A <strong>queryProgress</strong> element can only contain events from a single query executed on a single node. If a query is executed on
                multiple nodes, events resulting from different nodes will be sent in different messages.

            <p>
                Events are asynchronous messages sent from the concentrator to devices registered with the concentrator and having subscribed to events from the concentrator.
                <link url='#subscribe'>Event subscription</link> can be activated using the <strong>subscribe</strong> command. You can also <link url='#subscribe2'>retrieve historical events</link>
                using the <strong>subscribe</strong> command.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each event is sent from the concentrator to each subscriber using a <strong>message</strong> stanza. Each such <strong>message</strong> stanza may contain multiple
                events. The following subsections list the different types of events that can be sent. Even though these examples may list only one element in a message stanza, this
                is not a limitation. Different types of events may also be mixed within the message stanza.
            </p>
            <p>
                Event subscriptions only last for as long as the client and concentrator both maintains presence. The concentrator must not persist
                event notification subscriptions, and if it goes offline and back online, or if the client goes offline or online again for any reason, the event subscription
                is removed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Node events may contain parameters or status messages. This depends on how the subscription was made. The <strong>parameters</strong> and <strong>messages</strong> attributes
                in the <strong>subscribe</strong> command determine if node parameters and/or status messages should be sent in event messages.

            <p>
                A concentrator can often store data from sensors locally (or remotely but controlled locally). Storage is done in <strong>field databases</strong>. A concentrator with
                only communicative abilities will publish zero such field databases (and support for none of the field database commands), while a pure metering database will publish 
                one or many field databases, but none of the nodes available in any of the different data sources are readable or writable. The nodes in this latter case only acts as 
                placeholders for the data that the concentrator is storing or controlling.

                    Once the parameter form has been filled out, a database readout can be started using the <strong>startDatabaseReadout</strong> command.
                    Data read from the concentrator will follow the same flow of sensor data as that described in &xep0323;. The only difference is that the 
                    read-out is started with the <strong>startDatabaseReadout</strong> command instead of the <strong>req</strong>
                    command of the sensor data namespace.

                (***) Note that <strong>cacheType</strong> is optional. In some data sources it might be necessary to include a cache type to allow for IDs that are not unique
                within the source. In these cases, it concentrator must include the cacheType attribute for nodes in the corresponding data source, and clients must use the corresponding 
                cacheType value when referencing the node. But if such a separation of IDs within a source is not required, the concentrator may ignore the cacheType attribute.
                In these instances clients may also ignore the cacheType attribute when referencing the nodes in the corresponding data source, or use the empty string as value for the
                cacheType value. The server must ignore empty cacheType values for data sources not using a cache type separation mechanism.

                It's important that the concentrator responds to unrecognized commands. This, to make sure future extensions to this document does not produce unexpected
                results in concentrators implementing a previous version, or in concentrators implementing only a subset of available commands.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a concentrator receives an element that it does not understand, it must do as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>If the element is received in a message stanza, the element must be ignored.</li>
                <li>If the element is received in an iq-result stanza, the element must be ignored.</li>
                <li>If the element is received in an iq-get or iq-set stanza, an iq-result stanza must be composed containing an element with the same name as the incoming
                element, but with <strong>Response</strong> appended to it, having a response code of <strong>NotImplemented</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

                The following example shows how unrecognized commands must be handled by the concentrator:

        <section2 topic='Single vs. batch commands'>
            <p>
                Many commands exist in single and batch versions. Large concentrators require efficient ways to manage sets of nodes simultaneously, while for small
                concentrators, it is sufficient to manage nodes one at a time.
            </p>
            <p>
                A concentrator is not required to implement both sets of commands if not desired. However, it must report which commands it supports in the
                <strong>getCapabilities</strong> command. A caller can then adapt its calls based on what commands are supported.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a caller wants to call the single item version of a command, but the concentrator only supports the batch version, it should call the batch version, but
                only include the single node in the list of nodes.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, if the caller wants to perform an operation on a set of nodes, but the concentrator only supports the single item version of the command,
                it needs to manually perform the operation on each node separately, unless failing the request is an option.

        <section2 topic='Localization'>
            <p>
                Localization of content can be performed if clients provide <strong>xml:lang</strong> attributes in commands made to the concentrator. If omitted, the
                <strong>default language</strong> will be used in responses. If provided, but the concentrator does not support localization, or the requested language,
                the <strong>default language</strong> will also be used.

        <section2 topic='Time Zones'>
            <p>
                Concentrators of larger sub-systems spanning multiple time-zones should specify all timestamps with time-zone information, so readers can perform comparisons
                of time information.
            </p>
            <p>
                Information read from a concentrator that lacks time-zone information should be considered to lie in the same time-zone as the reader, unless not explicitly
                configured with a time-zone.

                For concentrators to be interoperable in sensor networks, they need to adhere to rules and guidelines described in the

        <section2 topic='Access rights'>
            <p>
                This document publishes a lot of commands with which to interact with a concentrator. If security and access rights is an issue, it might not be sufficient
                to allow all friends access to the system. There are many ways in which to restrict access to the contents of the concentrator. Following are some examples:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The concentrator can restrict friendships to trusted friends, and then assign access rights internally to the approved contacts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The concentrator can use a provisioning server (see &xep0324;) 
                    to delegate trust to a third party responsible for controlling who can get access to the concentrator (<strong>isFriend</strong> or <strong>canAccess</strong> commands), 
                    and what items can be viewed (<strong>hasPrivilege</strong> or <strong>downloadPrivileges</strong> commands).
                </li>
                <li>
                    All requests to the concentrator can contain the optional attributes <strong>deviceToken</strong>, <strong>serviceToken</strong> and <strong>userToken</strong>.
                    Clients making requests to the concentrator can use these attributes to forward information about who originated the action (<strong>userToken</strong>),
                    what service is performing the action (<strong>serviceToken</strong>) or what device is performing the action (<strong>deviceToken</strong>). The concentrator
                    can use this information to check with provisioning servers what access rights and user privileges exist before performing the action.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <section2 topic='Integration with provisioning servers'>
            <p>
                The <link url='http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0324.html'>Internet of Things - Provisioning</link> document describes how trust can be delegated to trusted provisioning servers
                that can be used to restrict access to and privileges in a network.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a concentrator has a trusted relationship with a provisioning server, external or internal, the provisioning server must be used to guarantee that the
                concentrator only allows access according to rules defined by the provisioning server. In order to do this, it's important that clients always provide
                available tokens (<strong>userToken</strong>, <strong>serviceToken</strong> and <strong>deviceToken</strong>) to the concentrator so that it can forward this
                information to the provisioning server.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following subsections show different examples of how such an integration can be performed.

                <p>
                    This section shows how a provisioning server can be used to restrict access to data sources to users allowed to access those data sources.
