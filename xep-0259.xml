<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>At the time of original writing of this XEP, many XMPP servers
  handle message stanzas sent to a user@host (or "bare") JID with no
  resource by delivering that message only to the resource with
  the highest priority for the target user.  Some server
  implementations, however, have chosen to send these messages to all
  of the online resources for the target user.  If the target user is
  online with multiple resources when the orginal message is sent, a
  conversation ensues on one of the user's devices; if the user
  subsequently switches devices, parts of the conversation may end up
  on the alternate device, causing the user to be confused, misled,
  or annoyed.</p>

  <p>This XEP proposes an approach for cleaning up the leftover
  conversation shards on alternate devices, paving the way for servers
  to deliver messages to multiple devices.  As the basic approach, the
  receiving server asks all of the resources of a user "whose message
  is this?".  The first resource to say "mine!" wins.</p>

  <section2 topic='Receving a message to the bare JID' anchor='receiving'>
    <p>When a server that implements the Mine capability receives a
    message addressed to a user's bare JID, it MUST:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure that no "whose" element is already on the message.
      See the <link url="#errors">Errors</link> section for processing.</li>
      <li>Add a whose element to the message, containing an id
      attribute with a new value</li>
      <li>Ensure that the the same value of the "id" attribute is
      never sent to the same session </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Messages that have been processed to include a valid "whose"
    element, are now also considered an "ownership request"</p>

  <section2 topic='Claiming ownership' anchor='claim'>
    <p>When one client for a receiving user detects that the user's
    attention has been directed to a given message, that client MUST
    send an ownership claim (mine!) to the bare JID of the receiving
    user.  If there was a thread element in the original message, it
    MUST be included in the acceptance notification.  There MUST NOT
    be a body element in the message, and the message SHOULD use the
    same message type as the ownership request.  The mine element MUST
    include an id element for each of the messages that the client
    wants to accept.  The mine element MUST include at least one
    id.</p>

    <p>When a client receives an ownership claim that was sent from

    been confirmed, and ignore any further ownership claims for
    that ID.</p>
    <p>When a client receives an ownership claim that was sent from
    a different client of the same user for a ID that has not
    been previously received, the client MUST note that the message
    associated with the ID has been retracted, and ignore any further
    ownership claims for that ID.  Retracted messages SHOULD
    be removed from the client's user interface, or otherwise marked
    in some way as retracted.</p>
    <p>Clients MUST ignore ownership claims for IDs for which they
    have no corresponding message.</p>
    <p>Assuming that messages are delivered and processed in order,
    these rules should ensure that exactly one client resource has a
    confirmed copy of the message</p>

  <section2 topic='Claims for Multi-User Chat rooms' anchor='muc'>
    <p>The same approach that has been described for one-to-one
    messages above can also be used by &xep0045; (MUC) rooms.
    Rooms that want to participate MUST send the
    'urn:xmpp:tmp:mine:0' feature in the room's disco info.  The room
    MUST then perform the role of the server in the above
    descriptions, ensuring that unique ID's are assigned to all
    outbound groupchat messages that were addressed to the bare JID of
    the room.  Ownership claims MUST be sent to the bare JID of the
    <strong>room</strong>, not the receiving user.</p>
    <p>This capability might be used to distribute questions to
    multiple experts in a room, such that a single expert answers a
    question.</p>

    <p>A server receives a message addressed to the bare JID of a
    user, from a different user than the one in the to address,
    containing a "whose" or "mine" element, it MUST NOT forward the
    message on to any clients.  This case is always either an attack,
    a misconfiguration, or the result of bad code.  If the user in the
    from address is already known to the user in the to address (for
    example, to user in the to address has a presence subscription to
    the user in the from address), the server MAY send back a helpful
    "bad-request" error.</p>

    <p>However, if the user in the from address is not known to the user

    errors, the server MUST treat the message as if it was addressed
    to an unknown user.  Otherwise, sending a message with an invalid
