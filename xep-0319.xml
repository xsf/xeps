<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>This protocol describes a way to communicate a user's last interaction time with other XMPP entities over &PRESENCE; stanzas. For the purposes of this document, user interaction here refers to a human end user interacting with her device by means of a keyboard, mouse, touch screen, and so on. Based on this information XMPP clients can display the time a contact went idle or a duration for how long a contact has been idle, thereby allowing end users to estimate the expected responsiveness of their contacts.</p>
  <p>This protocol uses absolute timestamps formatted according to the DateTime profile of &xep0082;, indicated as value of the 'since' attribute in the &lt;idle/&gt; element.</p>
  <p>Experience has shown a number of issues with &xep0256;:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The use of relative durations is too vague. It requires additional information from &xep0203; to provide a reliable user experience.</li>
    <li>Distinguishing between the idle and last online use cases is very difficult.</li>
    <li>It is desirable to have idle time indiciated for &PRESENCE; &lt;show/&gt; values other than "away" and "xa".</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Updating <cite>XEP-0256</cite> directly would be problematic as it would break compatibility with existing implementations.  Instead a new protocol is described for handling the idle time use case; the last online use case is handled by &xep0312;.</p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Use Cases' anchor='usecases'>
  <p>There are two main use cases for this extension, explained in more detail in the following sections.</p>
  <section2 topic='Presence with Last Interaction' anchor='last-interact'>
  <p>After a user has not interacted with her device for some amount of time the user wants to inform her contacts about this fact. The client sends a &PRESENCE; stanza with time of last interaction.</p>
  <example caption='Time of Last User Interaction in Auto-Away'><![CDATA[
<presence from='juliet@capulet.com/balcony'>
  <show>away</show>
  <idle xmlns='urn:xmpp:idle:1' since='1969-07-21T02:56:15Z'/>
</presence>
]]></example>
  <p>The amount of time the user has to be idle before a client sends this enhanced presence is application-specific; it is suggested that a sensible default interval of 5 minutes be used.</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Presence Indicating User Coming Back From Idle' anchor='back-from-idle'>
    <p>When a user comes back and uses her device again the client informs user's contacts by sending a normal presence stanza like shown in the following example, omiting the &lt;idle/&gt; element.</p>
    <example caption='Presence Indicating Return to Device'><![CDATA[
<presence from='juliet@capulet.com/balcony' />
]]></example>

  <p>Thanks to Florian Schmaus, Christian Schudt, and Lance Stout for their helpful comments.</p>

<section1 topic='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>
  <p>The security considerations of <cite>XEP-0082</cite> apply to this protocol.</p>
  <p>This specification introduces no new security or privacy concerns. While including a last user interaction notation in &PRESENCE; updates can enable recipients to determine exactly when a user has stopped interacting with her XMPP client or even their system, this information is in essence already available if the user's client publishes timely presence updates.</p>

<section1 topic='IANA Considerations' anchor='iana'>
  <p>This document requires no interaction with &IANA;.</p>
