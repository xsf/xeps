  <title>Jingle File Transfer</title>
  <abstract>This specification defines a Jingle application type for transferring a file from one entity to another. The protocol provides a modular framework that enables the exchange of information about the file to be transferred as well as the negotiation of parameters such as the transport to be used.</abstract>

<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>&xep0166; can be used to initiate and negotiate a wide range of peer-to-peer sessions. One session type of interest is file transfer. This document specifies an application format for negotiating Jingle file transfer sessions, where files are exchanged via any available reliable transport.</p>
</section1>

<section1 topic='Requirements'>
  <p>&xep0096; was the original XMPP protocol extension for file transfer negotiation. However, that protocol has several drawbacks, most related to the &xep0095; protocol on which it depends:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>It does not enable a true, bidirectional negotiation; instead, the initiator sets the terms for the file transfer and the responder either accepts the terms or cancels the negotiation.</p></li>
    <li><p>It is the only technology in the Jabber/XMPP protocol "stack" that uses <cite>XEP-0095: Stream Initiation</cite>. More modern technologies such as voice and video session negotiation use &xep0166;, and it would be helpful if implementors could re-use the same code for all negotiation use cases.</p></li>
  </ol>
  <p>To overcome these drawbacks, this specification defines a file transfer negotiation method that meets the following requirements:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Use the session negotiation semantics from <cite>XEP-0166</cite>.</p></li>
    <li>
      <p>Use any reliable Jingle transport mechanism, including but not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>ICE-TCP &rfc6544;</li>
        <li>SOCKS5 Bytestreams &xep0260;</li>
        <li>In-Band Bytestreams &xep0261;</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p>Define a file description format that, unlike <cite>XEP-0096</cite>, enables hash agility (via &xep0300;).</p></li>
    <li><p>Define a clear upgrade path from SI File Transfer to Jingle File Transfer.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note that Jingle file transfer is only as reliable as the transports on which it depends. In particular, SOCKS5 Bytestreams ("S5B") does not always result in NAT or firewall traversal. To work around that problem, this specification requires all implementations to support as a fallback mechanism In-Band Bytestreams ("IBB"), which usually results in a successful (if slow) file transfer. A more robust and adaptable option is ICE-TCP (RFC 6544); at the time of writing &xep0176; is being updated to include the ability to negotiate ICE-TCP candidates.</p>

<section1 topic='Jingle Conformance'>
  <p>In accordance with Section 12 of <cite>XEP-0166</cite>, this document specifies the following information related to the Jingle File Transfer ("Jingle FT") application type:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>The application format negotiation process is defined in the <link url='#negotiation'>Negotiating a Jingle File Transfer Session</link> section of this document.</p></li>
    <li><p>The semantics of the &DESCRIPTION; element are defined in the <link url='#format'>Application Format</link> section of this document.</p></li>
    <li><p>A mapping of Jingle semantics to the Session Description Protocol is provided in the <link url='#sdp'>Mapping to Session Description Protocol</link> section of this document.</p></li>
    <li><p>A Jingle File Transfer session SHOULD use a streaming transport method, not a datagram transport method.</p></li>
    <li><p>Transport components are not used in Jingle File Transfer.</p></li>
    <li>
      <p>Content is to be sent and received as follows:</p>
      <p>For streaming transports, outbound content shall be encoded into packets (as defined by the transport mechanism) without any other framing mechanism and sent in succession over the transport. Incoming data received over the transport shall be processed as a stream of packets, where each packet's content payload is entirely composed of the next portion of file data to be processed.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <section2 topic='Use of Jingle Content Senders' anchor='content-senders'>
    <p>Jingle File Transfer makes critical use of the 'senders' attribute of Jingle &CONTENT; elements in order to specify which party is responsible for sending the described file. As such, Jingle File Transfer content MUST include a 'senders' attribute, where the allowed values are "initiator" and "responder". The semantics of the values "both" and "none" are undefined in Jingle File Transfer and thus NOT RECOMMENDED for use with Jingle File Transfer content.</p>
    <p>In general, a Jingle File Transfer content is said to be a "File Offer" if the 'senders' attribute is the same as the role of the party adding the content to the session, and a "File Request" if the 'senders' value is the opposite role of the party adding the content.</p>
    <p>Note: The content 'creator' attribute does <em>not</em> specify who created or is sending the file, it only specifies which party to the session added the Jingle content to the session.</p>

<section1 topic='Application Format'>
  <p>A Jingle File Transfer session is described by a content type that contains one application format and one transport method. Each &CONTENT; element defines the details of a single file transfer. A Jingle negotiation MAY result in the establishment of multiple file transfers by including multiple &CONTENT; elements.</p>
  <p>The application format consists of a file description contained within a &DESCRIPTION; element qualified by the "urn:xmpp:jingle:apps:file-transfer:4" namespace &VNOTE;. The file description is a &lt;file/&gt; element specifying metadata such as the name of the file, media type, etc., as illustrated in the following example.</p>
  <code><![CDATA[
<description xmlns='urn:xmpp:jingle:apps:file-transfer:4'>
  <file>
    <media-type>text/plain</media-type>
    <name>test.txt</name>
    <date>2015-07-26T21:46:00</date>
    <size>6144</size>
    <hash xmlns='urn:xmpp:hashes:1' 
          algo='sha-1'>552da749930852c69ae5d2141d3766b1</hash>
  </file>
</description>]]></code>
  <p>The &DESCRIPTION; element is intended to be a child of a Jingle &CONTENT; element as specified in <cite>XEP-0166</cite>.</p>
  <p>The child elements of the &lt;file/&gt; element are as follows:</p>
  <table caption='File Description Elements'>
    <tr>
      <th>Element Name</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Inclusion</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>date</td>
      <td>UTC timestamp specifying the last modified time of the file (which MUST conform to the DateTime profile of &xep0082;).</td>
      <td>OPTIONAL</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>desc</td>
      <td>A human readable description of the file. Multiple &lt;desc/&gt; elements MAY be included if different xml:lang values are specified.</td>
      <td>OPTIONAL</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>hash</td>
      <td>A hash of the file content, using the &lt;hash/&gt; element defined in &xep0300; and qualifed by the 'urn:xmpp:hashes:1' namespace. Multiple hashes MAY be included for hash agility.</td>
      <td>REQUIRED when offering a file, otherwise OPTIONAL</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>media-type</td>
      <td>The media type of the file content, which SHOULD be a valid MIME-TYPE as registered with &IANA; (specifically, as listed at &lt;<link url='http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types'>http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types</link>&gt;). If not specified, the content is assumed to be "application/octet-stream".</td>
      <td>RECOMMENDED when offering a file, otherwise OPTIONAL</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>name</td>
      <td>The name of the file. The name SHOULD NOT contain characters or character sequences that would be interpreted as a directory structure by the local file system (e.g. "/", "\", "../", etc.). If any such characters or character sequences are present (possibly because the local and remote file systems use different syntax for directory structure), they SHOULD be escaped (e.g., via percent-encoding) before using the name as part of any file system operation. See <link url='#security'>Security Considerations</link>.</td>
      <td>OPTIONAL</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>size</td>
      <td>The length of the file's content, in bytes.</td>
      <td>OPTIONAL, but SHOULD be present when offering a file.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>range</td>
      <td>The presence of the &lt;range/&gt; element indicates support of ranged transfers, and can be used to control where a transfer starts.</td>
      <td>OPTIONAL</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>One or more &lt;hash/&gt; elements MUST be present when offering a file, but those elements MAY be empty if the hash has not yet been computed. If there is no computed hash value, the &lt;hash/&gt; element(s) MUST possess an 'algo' attribute specifying which hash algorithm will be used. Once a hash has been calculated by the File Sender, the File Sender SHOULD inform the File Receiver of the hash value as described in <link url='#checksum'>Checksum</link>.</p>
  <p>Additional elements MAY be included as children of the &lt;file/&gt; element to provide additional metadata about the file, such as &xep0264;.</p>
  <p>The optional &lt;range/&gt; element MAY possess two attributes:</p>
  <table caption='Range Element Attributes'>
    <tr>
      <th>Attribute</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Inclusion</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>offset</td>
      <td>Specifies the position, in bytes, from which to start transferring file data. This defaults to zero (0) if not specified.</td>
      <td>OPTIONAL</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>length</td>
      <td>Specifies the number of bytes to retrieve starting at offset. This defaults to the length of the file from offset to the end.</td>
      <td>OPTIONAL</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Inclusion of a &lt;range/&gt; element in a File Offer indicates support of ranged transfers for future File Requests if the transfer is interrupted and needs to be restarted.</p>
  <p>A &lt;range/&gt; element MAY include an 'offset' attribute set to begin the transfer at a point other than the start of the file, and MAY include a 'length' attribute to request a portion of the file smaller than the remaining length of the file. If no 'offset' or 'length' attributes are present then it is the same as if no &lt;range/&gt; element was present, because the default values of the attributes would indicate a requested range of the entire file. In general, the first byte of data to be transferred is at the (zero-indexed) position specified by the 'offset' value, with a total of 'length' bytes sent.</p>
</section1>

<section1 topic='Negotiating a Jingle File Transfer Session'>
  <p>In general, the process for negotiating a Jingle File Transfer session is as follows:</p>
  <code><![CDATA[
Initiator                    Responder
   |                             |

   |============================>|
   |                             |]]></code>

  <section2 topic='Offering a File' anchor='offering'>
    <p>To start a File Offer, the initiator sends a Jingle session-initiation request to a potential responder. The request specifies three things:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>A content 'senders' attribute with the value of 'initiator' to indicate this is a File Offer.</li>
      <li>An application type of "urn:xmpp:jingle:apps:file-transfer:4". In particular, the &lt;description/&gt; element contains a &lt;file/&gt; elements describing the file to be sent.</li>
      <li>An appropriate transport method.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In this example, the initiator is &lt;romeo@montague.example&gt;, the responder is &lt;juliet@capulet.example&gt;, the application type is a File Offer, and the transport method is jingle-s5b (XEP-0260).</p>
    <p>The flow is as follows.</p>
    <p>First the initiator sends a Jingle session-initiate.</p>

    <p>As in <cite>XEP-0096</cite>, a transfer can include only part of a file (e.g., to restart delivery of a truncated transfer session at a point other than the start of the file). This is done using the &lt;range/&gt; element. The usage is illustrated in the following examples.</p>
    <p>Let us imagine that the parties negotiate a file transfer session using, say, In-Band Bytestreams. During the transfer, the recipient goes offline unexpectedly and IBB stanzas from the File Sender to the File Receiver begin to bounce. When the recipient comes back online, the File Sender could initiate a new Jingle session and specify that it wants to send all chunks after byte 270336 (which might be the 66th chunk of size 4096).</p>

<section1 topic='Mapping to Session Description Protocol' anchor='sdp'>
  <p>&rfc5547; defines the general process for including file transfer information in SDP.</p>
  <p>The SDP media type for Jingle File Transfer can be "message" (e.g. when used with &rfc4975;) or "application"; however, this media value is not reflected in the Jingle File Transfer application format.</p>
  <p>Any combination of &lt;name/&gt;, &lt;size/&gt;, &lt;media-type/&gt;and &lt;hash/&gt; values MAY be used to form a "file selector" (see Section 5 of &rfc5547;), which would be mapped to SDP as follows:</p>
  <code><![CDATA[
a=file-selector [name:"<name>"] [size:<size>] [type:<media-type>] [hash:<hash algo>:<hash value>]]]></code>
  <p>(The hash value MUST be encoded as hexadecimal with each byte separated by a colon.)</p>
  <p>The &lt;date/&gt; value is the last modified time of the file, and thus is mapped as follows:</p>
  <code><![CDATA[
a=file-date:modification:"<date>"]]></code>
  <p>Note: the format used here for &lt;date&gt; is the date-time format defined in &rfc5322;.</p>
  <p>If a range is specified, the SDP mapping requires both a start and stop offset. If no length was specified for the range, the stop offset is "*". If a length was specified, the stop offset is the &lt;range/&gt; offset value plus the length.</p>
  <code><![CDATA[
a=file-range:<offset>-<(offset + length) | *>]]></code>
  <p>As a full example, given the following Jingle File Transfer content description:</p>
  <code><![CDATA[
<description xmlns='urn:xmpp:jingle:apps:file-transfer:4'>
  <file>
    <media-type>text/plain</media-type>
    <name>test.txt</name>
    <date>2015-07-26T21:46:00</date>
    <size>6144</size>

    <range offset='1024' />
  </file>
</description>]]></code>
    <p>The equivalent SDP would be:</p>
    <code><![CDATA[
a=file-selector: name:"test.txt" size:6144 type:text/plain hash:sha-1:55:2D:A7:49:93:08:52:C6:9A:E5:D2:14:1D:37:66:B1

  <section2 topic='Checksum' anchor='hash'>
    <p>At any time during the lifetime of the file transfer session, the File Sender can communicate the checksum of the file to the File Receiver.</p>
    <p>This can be done in the session-initiate message if the File Sender already knows the checksum, as shown above in Example 3.</p>
    <p>After the session-initiate message, this can also be done by sending a session-info message containing a &lt;checksum/&gt; element qualified by the 'urn:xmpp:jingle:apps:file-transfer:4' namespace. The &lt;checksum/&gt; element SHOULD contain 'creator' and 'name' attributes sufficient to identitfy the content the checksum belongs to.  Additionally, the &lt;checksum/&gt; element MUST contain a &lt;file/&gt; element which MUST contain at least one &lt;hash/&gt; element qualified by the 'urn:xmpp:hashes:1' namespace. Each &lt;hash/&gt; element contains a checksum of the file data produced in accordance with the hashing function specified by the 'algo' attribute, which MUST be one of the functions listed in the &ianahashes;.</p>

    <p>If a ranged transfer was requested, the &lt;file/&gt; element inside the &lt;checksum/&gt; element MAY include a &lt;range/&gt; element specifying the offset and length of the requested range, which in turn includes &lt;hash/&gt; element(s) with hashes of the data that was transferred for that range.</p>

    <p>If the initiator wishes to communicate only the hashing algorithm at the beginning of the session (e.g., because it has not yet calculated the checksum), it can send an empty &lt;hash/&gt; element (without a checksum in the XML character data as shown in the previous examples) in the session-initiate message; this enables the recipient to check the file during the transfer session (which can be helpful in the case of transfers that are truncated or fail mid-stream).</p>

  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Migration from XEP-0096' anchor='impl-migration'>
    <p>Support for Jingle file transfer can be determined through discovery of the 'urn:xmpp:jingle:apps:file-transfer:4' namespace &VNOTE;, via either service discovery (<cite>XEP-0030</cite>) or entity capabilities (<cite>XEP-0115</cite>). If the initiator knows that the responder supports Jingle file transfer, it SHOULD first attempt negotiation using Jingle rather than Stream Initiation.</p>

<section1 topic='Determining Support' anchor='support'>
  <p>To advertise its support for the Jingle File Transfer, when replying to service discovery information ("disco#info") requests an entity MUST return URNs for any version of this protocol that the entity supports -- e.g., "urn:xmpp:jingle:apps:file-transfer:4" for this version &VNOTE;.</p>

  <p>In order for an application to determine whether an entity supports this protocol, where possible it SHOULD use the dynamic, presence-based profile of service discovery defined in &xep0115;. However, if an application has not received entity capabilities information from an entity, it SHOULD use explicit service discovery instead.</p>
</section1>

<section1 topic='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>
    <p>Caution needs to be exercised when using the &lt;name/&gt; of a file offer or request to control any interaction with a file system. For example, a malicious user could request a file with &lt;name&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/name&gt; or include file system specific control patterns such as &lt;name&gt;../../private.txt&lt;/name&gt; to try and access a sensitive file outside of the set of files intended to be shared. Or a malicious user could offer a file named "/etc/passwd" to try and trick the receiver into overwriting that or other sensitive files. Therefore, implementations SHOULD escape any file system path separators in the &lt;name/&gt; before using that value in any file system calls.</p>
  <p>It is RECOMMENDED for implementations to use the strongest hashing algorithm available to both parties. See <cite>XEP-0300</cite> for further discussion.</p>
  <p>In order to secure the data stream, implementations SHOULD use encryption methods appropriate to the transport method being used. For example, end-to-end encryption can be negotiated over either SOCKS5 Bytestreams or In-Band Bytestreams as described in <cite>XEP-0260</cite> and <cite>XEP-0261</cite>.</p>
