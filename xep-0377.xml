<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>
    Many spam and abuse prevention techniques rely on users being able to report
    other users who are sending unwanted messages, or specific instances of
    abuse.
    &xep0191; allows users to block spammers, but does not provide a mechanism
    for them to report a reason for the block to the server operator.
    This specification extends the blocking command to optionally provide an
    abuse report.
  </p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Background' anchor='background'>
  <p>
    This document extends the blocking command instead of providing a separate
    reporting IQ because we hypothesize that this will slightly lower the levels
    of false reports received by service operators.
    We have observed a common pattern on the internet where a user becomes mad
    at or disagrees with another user and begins harassing them by replying to
    or reporting their every comment even if it is not itself spam or abusive.
    However, this sort of behavior cannot continue if the harasser can no longer
    read the messages of the person they are stalking.
    Giving them a choice between their abusive behavior and being able to
    read their targets can possibly force them to break the cycle and only
    create valid reports.
  </p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Discovering Support' anchor='disco'>
  <section2 topic='Protocol Support' anchor='disco-proto'>
    <p>
      Entities that support &xep0030; and abuse reporting using the blocking
      command as defined in this spec MUST respond to service discovery requests
      with a feature of 'urn:xmpp:reporting:1'.
      Support for this namespace also indicates support for the abuse reporting
      reasons defined in this document.
      For example, a response from a server that supports reporting and
      understands the abuse and spam reasons defined later in this specification
      might look like the following:
    </p>
    <example caption="Service discovery information response"><![CDATA[
    <iq from='example.net'
      id='ku6e51v3'
      to='kingclaudius@example.net/castle'
      type='result'>
    <query xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/disco#info'>
      …
      <feature var='urn:xmpp:reporting:1'/>
      …
    </query>
</iq>]]></example>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Reasons Support' anchor='disco-reasons'>
    <p>
      It is sometimes desirable to know whether the remote entity understands
      the reason for a report.
      For example, a client may wish to know what reasons a server understands
      and limit the user to selecting from those reasons.
      Therefore implementations of this protocol MUST advertise supported
      reasons when queried via disco#info with the service discovery node
      "urn:xmpp:reporting:1".
    </p>
    <example caption="Service discovery reasons response"><![CDATA[
    <iq from='kingclaudius@example.net/castle'
      id='ku6e51v3'
      to='example.net'
      type='result'>
    <query xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/disco#info'
           node='urn:xmpp:reporting:1'>
      …
      <feature var='urn:xmpp:reporting:abuse'/>
      <feature var='urn:xmpp:reporting:spam'/>
      …
    </query>
</iq>]]></example>
    <p>
      The features MUST correspond to the protocol URNs of registered reasons as
      defined later in this document.
    </p>
  </section2>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Payload' anchor='payload'>
  <p>
    The payload for reporting abuse to the server takes the form of a
    &lt;report/&gt; qualified by the 'urn:xmpp:reporting:1' namespace &VNOTE;.
  </p>
  <example caption='The most basic report payload'><![CDATA[
<report xmlns="urn:xmpp:reporting:1" reason="urn:xmpp:reporting:spam"/>]]></example>
  <p>
    Abuse reports MUST include a reason for the report in the "reason" attribute.
  </p>
  <p>
    This document defines the following reasons for a report:
  </p>
  <dl>
    <di>
      <dt>urn:xmpp:reporting:spam</dt>
      <dd>Used for reporting a JID that is sending unwanted messages.</dd>
    </di>
    <di>
      <dt>urn:xmpp:reporting:abuse</dt>
      <dd>Used for reporting general abuse.</dd>
    </di>
  </dl>
  <p>
    Reports MAY contain a user provided message explaining or providing context
    about the reason for the report.
    See also the <link url='#i18n'>Internationalization Considerations</link>
    section of this document.
  </p>
  <example caption='Report with optional reason and text'><![CDATA[
<report xmlns="urn:xmpp:reporting:1" reason="urn:xmpp:reporting:spam">
  <text xml:lang="en">
    Never came trouble to my house like this.
  </text>
</report>]]></example>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Use with the Blocking Command' anchor='blocking'>
  <p>
    To send a report, a report payload MAY be inserted into an &lt;item/&gt;
    node sent as part of a request to block a spammer as defined in &xep0191;.
    For example:
  </p>
  <example caption='Report sent with blocking command'><![CDATA[
<iq from='juliet@example.com/chamber' type='set' id='block1'>
  <block xmlns='urn:xmpp:blocking'>
    <item jid='romeo@example.net'>
      <report xmlns="urn:xmpp:reporting:1" reason="urn:xmpp:reporting:abuse"/>
    </item>
  </block>
</iq>]]></example>
  <p>
    Servers that receive a blocking command with a report MUST block the JID or
    return an error just as they would if no report were present.
    Servers then MAY take other actions based on the report, however, such
    actions are outside the scope of this document.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the server supports &xep0313; the report MAY also include the stanza-id
    of specific messages being reported.
    This is done by including copies of each &lt;stanza-id/&gt; element that the
    user wishes to report as a child of the &lt;report/&gt; element.
    The stanza indicated by the provided stanza-id SHOULD be by the same JID
    being reported and blocked.
  </p>
  <example caption='Report sent with stanza IDs'><![CDATA[
<iq from='juliet@example.com/chamber' type='set' id='block1'>
  <block xmlns='urn:xmpp:blocking'>
    <item jid='romeo@example.net'>
      <report xmlns="urn:xmpp:reporting:1" reason="urn:xmpp:reporting:spam">
        <stanza-id xmlns='urn:xmpp:sid:0' by='romeo@example.net' id='28482-98726-73623'/>
        <stanza-id xmlns='urn:xmpp:sid:0' by='romeo@example.net' id='38383-38018-18385'/>
        <text xml:lang="en">
          Never came trouble to my house like this.
        </text>
      </report>
    </item>
  </block>
</iq>]]></example>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Implementation Notes' anchor='impl'>
  <p>
    Clients that support sending reports as part of the blocking command SHOULD
    expose interfaces to both block a JID without reporting it as abuse, and to
    block and report a JID.
  </p>
  <p>
    The blocking command may be used to block multiple JIDs at the same time.
    When blocking multiple JIDs any abuse report only applies to a single JID.
    If the client allows selecting multiple JIDs in an abuse reporting dialog
    they SHOULD also allow choosing a separate reason, text, and messages for
    each JID.
    They MAY choose to only allow reporting a single JID at a time as well when
    the "block and report" dialog is accessed, and multiple JIDs when the
    "block" dialog is accessed.
  </p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Internationalization Considerations' anchor='i18n'>
  <p>
    If one or more &lt;text/&gt; elements are present they SHOULD include
    'xml:lang' attributes specifying the natural language of the XML character
    data.
  </p>

  <section1 topic='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>
