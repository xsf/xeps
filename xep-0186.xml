<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>Some instant messaging implementations of the Jabber/XMPP protocols have long supported the ability for IM users to be online but appear invisible. The existing protocols for doing so are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>&xep0018; -- this protocol is not compatible with &xmppcore; and &xmppim;, and the specification does not provide reliable documentation of the protocol in use since many server implementations support presence of type "invisible" but not presence of type "visible".</p></li>
    <li><p>&xep0126; -- this protocol is a somewhat complicated use of &xep0016; for the temporary purpose of appearing invisible rather than the intended purpose of permanently blocking communications; however, the invisible command defined herein can provide a client-friendly interface to the same data store used for privacy lists.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>In order to provide a standards-compliant protocol that can be used in the long term, this document defines an IQ-based protocol that enables an IM user to become "invisible" and "visible" at will within the context of a given session. This protocol is intended to supersede the protocol described in <cite>XEP-0018</cite> and to provide a more client-friendly approach to invisibility than <cite>XEP-0126</cite>.</p>
</section1>

<section1 topic='Requirements' anchor='req'>
  <p>The requirements for invisible mode are straightforward:</p>
  <ol start='1'>
    <li>A user can become visible or invisible at any time within an XMPP session.</li>
    <li>Invisible mode is active only for the current session; if the user ends that session and starts another session, the invisibility mode set for the previous session does not carry over to the new session.</li>
    <li>When in invisible mode, a user can send directed presence to particular contacts.</li>
  </ol>
</section1>

<section1 topic='Use Cases' anchor='usecases'>
  <section2 topic='User Becomes Invisible' anchor='invisible'>
    <p>In order for a client to go invisible, it shall send an IQ-set with no 'to' address (thus handled by the user's server) containing an &lt;invisible/&gt; element qualified by the 'urn:xmpp:invisible:0' namespace &VNOTE;.</p>
    <example caption='Invisible command'><![CDATA[
<iq from='bilbo@tolkien.lit/shire'
    id='inv1'
    type='set'>
  <invisible xmlns='urn:xmpp:invisible:0'/>
</iq>
    ]]></example>
    <p>If the server can successfully process the invisibility command, it MUST return an IQ-result.</p>
    <example caption='Invisible command is successful'><![CDATA[
<iq to='bilbo@tolkien.lit/shire'
    id='inv1'
    type='result'/>
    ]]></example>
    <p>(Standard XMPP stanza errors apply; see <cite>RFC 3920</cite> and &xep0086;.)</p>
    <p>If the client enters invisible mode after having previously sent undirected presence with no 'type' attribute (e.g., after sending initial presence), the server MUST send &UNAVAILABLE; presence from the specified resource to all contacts who would receive unavailable presence if the client sent &UNAVAILABLE;.</p>
    <p>While the client is in invisible mode, the server:</p>
    <ol start='1'>
      <li><p>MUST NOT broadcast presence notifications as a result of receiving any subsequent undirected presence notifications from the client.</p></li>
      <li><p>MUST deliver directed presence stanzas generated by the client.</p></li>
      <li><p>MUST deliver inbound &PRESENCE; stanzas.</p></li>
      <li><p>SHOULD deliver inbound &MESSAGE; stanzas whose 'to' address is the bare JID &LOCALBARE; of the user (subject to standard XMPP stanza handling rules).</p></li>
      <li><p>MUST deliver inbound &MESSAGE; and &IQ; stanzas whose 'to' address is the full JID &LOCALFULL; corresponding to the resource of the client.</p></li>
      <li><p>MUST deliver outbound &MESSAGE; and &IQ; stanzas generated by the client (for an important note regarding presence leaks, see the <link url='#security'>Security Considerations</link> section of this document).</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>If after sending directed presence the client then sends &UNAVAILABLE;, the server MUST deliver that unavailable presence only to the entities to which the client sent directed presence after going invisible.</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='User Becomes Visible' anchor='visible'>
    <p>In order for a client to become visible again, it shall send an IQ-set with no 'to' address (thus handled by the user's server) containing a &lt;visible/&gt; element qualified by the 'urn:xmpp:invisible:0' namespace &VNOTE;.</p>
    <example caption='Visible command'><![CDATA[
<iq from='bilbo@tolkien.lit/shire'
    id='vis1'
    type='set'>
  <visible xmlns='urn:xmpp:invisible:0'/>
</iq>
    ]]></example>
    <p>If the server can successfully process the visibility command, it MUST return an IQ-result.</p>
    <example caption='Visible command is successful'><![CDATA[
<iq to='bilbo@tolkien.lit/shire'
    id='vis1'
    type='result'/>
    ]]></example>
    <p>When the client becomes visible, the server MUST treat that state as equivalent to an active session before receiving initial presence from the client.</p>
    <p>It is the responsibility of the client to send an undirected presence notification to the server.</p>
    <example caption='Client sends presence'><![CDATA[
<presence/>
    ]]></example>
    <p>The server then MUST broadcast that presence to all entities who would normally receive presence broadcasts from the client (as well as any other entities to which the client sent directed presence while invisible).</p>
  </section2>
</section1>

<section1 topic='Discovering Support' anchor='support'>
  <p>In order for a client to discover whether its server supports the protocol defined herein, it MUST send a &xep0030; information request to the server:</p>
  <example caption='Service discovery request'><![CDATA[
<iq from='bilbo@tolkien.lit/shire'
    id='disco1'
    to='tolkien.lit'
    type='get'>
  <query xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/disco#info'/>
</iq>
  ]]></example>
  <p>If the server supports the protocol defined herein, it MUST return a feature of "urn:xmpp:invisible:0" &VNOTE;.</p>
  <example caption='Service discovery response'><![CDATA[
<iq from='bilbo@tolkien.lit/shire'
    id='disco1'
    to='tolkien.lit'
    type='result'>
  <query xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/disco#info'>
    <feature var='urn:xmpp:invisible:0'/>
  </query>
</iq>
  ]]></example>
  <p>A client SHOULD complete this service discovery process before sending initial presence to its server.</p>
</section1>

<section1 topic='Integration With Privacy Lists' anchor='priv'>
  <p>A server MAY use the same backend data store for invisibility mode as defined herein and &xep0016; as used for invisibility (see <cite>XEP-0126</cite>). If so, the server MUST update the relevant privacy lists on behalf of the user when the client requests initiation or termination of invisible mode.</p>
</section1>

<section1 topic='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>
  <p>It is important to recognize that invisibility can be defeated without the use of privacy lists, intelligent stanza handling by the server, and an awareness of context on the part of a client. For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If a user attempts to send a message, IQ, or presence stanza to a contact, the user can inadvertently leak his or her presence; therefore the client SHOULD warn the user before allowing the user to generate any outbound traffic, including "is-composing" events as defined in &xep0085;.</li>
    <li>If a user usually logs in as the same resource (e.g., "Home"), a contact can send an IQ request to that resource's full JID using &xep0012;, &xep0030;, &xep0090;, or &xep0092; and receive a reply, thus providing information that reveals the user's availability.</li>
    <li>If a contact sends a <cite>Last Activity</cite> request to the user's bare JID, the user's server normally would reveal information about the user's availability; however, while the user is in invisible mode the server MUST return a &unavailable; error to such contacts.</li>
  </ul>

<section1 topic='XMPP Registrar Considerations' anchor='registrar'>
  <section2 topic='Protocol Namespaces' anchor='registrar-ns'>
    <p>This specification defines the following XML namespace:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>urn:xmpp:invisible:0</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Upon advancement of this specification from a status of Experimental to a status of Draft, the &REGISTRAR; shall add the foregoing namespace to the registry located at &NAMESPACES;, as described in Section 4 of &xep0053;.</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Protocol Versioning' anchor='registrar-versioning'>
    <p>If the protocol defined in this specification undergoes a major revision that is not fully backward-compatible with an older version, or that contains significant new features, the XMPP Registrar shall increment the protocol version number found at the end of the XML namespaces defined herein, as described in Section 4 of <cite>XEP-0053</cite>.</p>
