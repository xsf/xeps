<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>MUC's design generally assumes a highly reliable network providing plenty of bandwidth, and it functions well in Internet settings. It is sometimes the case that server to server traffic is heavily constrained, with typical problems for constrained links being high latency, tiny amounts of available bandwidth and unreliability (including, potentially, long-term failure of S2S links). This document provides methods for allowing experiences close to those of standard MUC use while operating across such constrained links by allowing rooms to federate with remote counterparts and for users to connect to the federated MUC node nearest to them on the network for a given FMUC room. It requires no setup in advance, and needs no bandwidth for remote rooms without local occupants. The premise is that a proxy room joins another room and receives stanzas from the MUC just as another occupant would; this is analogous to the client to server model, whereby a client would connect to their local server and the server deals with connections elsewhere - the client joins a local room and the room deals with connections to other federated rooms.</p>

  <section2 topic='Terminology' anchor='terminology'>
    <p>As MUCs are generally self-contained entities with a single address, federating them requires the introduction of some new terminology:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>FMUC set - the union of all MUC rooms that federate together</li>
      <li>FMUC node - a single MUC room that is a member of an FMUC set</li>
      <li>FMUC room - a room represented by an FMUC set</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For illustration: if room1@rooms.server1.lit and room2@rooms.server2.lit federate with each other, then room1@rooms.server1.lit is an FMUC node, as is room2@rooms.server2.lit. Both nodes are in the FMUC set (along with any other node rooms that mutually federate) while the conceptual single room created by joining the FMUC set together is the FMUC room (and this FMUC room does not have a single definitive identifier).</p>
  </section2>
</section1>

<section1 topic='Requirements' anchor='reqs'>
  <ul>
  <li>If appropriately configured, avoid bandwidth use that isn't strictly necessary for message exchange.</li>
  <li>Allow conversation in a federated MUC to continue when one of the federated nodes is unavailable (e.g. due to network failure preventing S2S links forming), such that the nodes operate in a 'peer to peer' or 'multi-master' mode.</li>
  <li>If configured, allow a master/slave configuration such that a disconnected node is no longer usable for local chat</li>
  <li><em>Acceptable compromise</em> When operating in multi-master mode the message ordering may not be consistent between FMUC nodes.</li>
  </ul>
</section1>

<section1 topic='Addressing' anchor='addressing'>
  <p>In Federated MUC an FMUC room does not have a single logical address; when joining the FMUC room a user's client can join any of the nodes in the FMUC set for that room, and all addressing will appear to that client as if this was the single canonical representation of the room's address - while other users in the room may see different addresses dependent upon the node they joined.</p>
  <p>It is possible, although not required, for an implementation and deployment to use &xep0106; to make naming schemes easy to manage, but this is a matter of deployment policy and not of the protocol defined herein.</p>

    <section3 topic='Success case' anchor='joinsuccess'>
<p>kev@remote.example.com/Swift joining jabberchat@talk.example.com through a pre-known mirror.remote.example.com service. At this point mirror.remote.example.com knows nothing of the jabberchat@talk.example.com MUC, and no existing proxying is in place beyond mirror.remote.example.com being willing to proxy for kev@remote.example.com</p>

<example caption='User joins MUC through a proxy'><![CDATA[

</presence>

<p>mirror.example.com then un-escapes 'jabberchat\40talk.example.com', and joins jabberchat@talk.example.com (the master), saying it's a room mirror.</p>

<example caption='Proxy service joins the target MUC'><![CDATA[

  <fmuc xmlns='http://isode.com/protocol/fmuc' from='kev@remote.example.com/Swift' />
</presence>
]]></example>

<p>jabberchat@talk.example.com recognises that the mirror service is now mirrorring it, and performs the usual ACL checks as if kev@example.com/Swift had joined directly, sending presence to all occupants as normal. For all in-room routing, the slave is now treated as an occupant, and the slave is expected to do fan-out to its users as it is itself a MUC.</p>

    <section3 topic='Failure case' anchor='joinfail'>
      <p>If the master doesn't allow the user to join, they send the standard MUC error to the slave. Note that for stanzas sent to a user on the slave (such as this join error), it sends to the full MUC JID of the user on the slave, not to the slave room as it does with most other stanzas.</p>

      <p>When the master MUC receives a parting presence from the only user of the proxy, the proxy itself also leaves the room. This means that as long as no users of the proxy are in the room, it is causing no traffic on the s2s link.</p>

      <p>When dealing with very constrained s2s links, the extra round-trip involved with the MUC sending the message back to the proxy may be unacceptable. In this case, the proxy MAY include the &lt;nomirror> element. If the MUC receives a message from a proxy with &lt;nomirror>, it MUST NOT resend this message to the proxy during its usual fan-out, but MUST send it to other occupants as usual. If sending a message with &lt;nomirror>, the proxy MUST perform fan-out as if the MUC had sent the message back to it.</p>
      <p>Note that this use introduces unfortunate side-effects, such as messages appearing out of order, depending on whether connected directly to the MUC, or through a proxy. Also, messages rejected by the MUC may already have been delivered to users on a proxy. As such, a proxy SHOULD only use &lt;nomirror> in environments where these side-effects are understood.</p>
