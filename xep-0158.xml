<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>The appearance of large public IM services based on &xmppcore; and &xmppim; makes it desirable to implement protocols that <em>discourage</em> the sending of large quantities of instant messaging spam (a.k.a. "spim") or, in general, abusive traffic. Abusive stanzas could be generated by XMPP clients connected to legitimate servers or by XMPP servers with virtual clients, where the malicious entities are hosted on networks of "zombie" machines. Such abusive stanas could take many forms; a full taxonomy is outside the scope of this document.</p>
  <p>One technique developed to combat abusive messages and behavior via non-XMPP technologies requires humans to be differentiated from bots using a "Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart" or CAPTCHA (see &lt;<link url='http://www.captcha.net/'>http://www.captcha.net/</link>&gt;). These challenge techniques are easily adapted to discourage XMPP abuse. The very occasional inconvenience of responding to a CAPTCHA (e.g., when creating an IM account or sending a message to a new correspondent) is small and perfectly acceptable -- especially when compared to the countless robot-generated interruptions people might otherwise have to filter every day.</p>
  <p>An alternative technique to CAPTCHAs requires Desktop PC clients to undertake a <span class='ref'>Hashcash</span> <note>Hashcash &lt;<link url='http://hashcash.org/'>http://hashcash.org/</link>&gt;.</note> challenge. These are completely transparent to PC users. They require clients to perform specified CPU-intensive work, making it difficult to send large amounts of abusive traffic.</p>
  <p>Both CAPTCHAs and hashcash have been criticized regarding their effectiveness (or lack thereof). Therefore, the challenge protocol specified herein provides a great deal of flexibility, so that challenges can include CAPTCHAs, hashcash, word puzzles, so-called kitten authentication, and any other mechanism that may be developed in the future.</p>
  <p>The generic challenge protocol described in this document is designed for incorporation into protocols such as &xep0077;, &xep0045;, &xep0016;, and &xep0159;.</p>
</section1>

<section1 topic='Requirements' anchor='require'>
  <section2 topic='Extensibility' anchor='require-extend'>
    <p>The CAPTCHAs in most common use today are Optical Character Recognition (OCR) challenges where an image containing deformed text is presented and the human enters the characters they can read. However, if OCR software advances more rapidly than the techniques used to disguise text from Artificial Intelligence (AI) then very different CAPTCHAs will need to be deployed. This protocol must be extensible enough to allow the incorporation of CAPTCHA techniques that may not have been envisaged.</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Variety' anchor='require-variety'>
    <p>Several common CAPTCHA techniques present major problems to users with disabilities (see &w3turingtest;). Clients running in constrained environments may not be able to perform some challenges (e.g., due to the absence of audio output or a lack of CPU performance). This protocol must allow clients to be offered a choice from a variety of challenges.</p>
  </section2>

<section1 topic='Protocol' anchor='protocol'>
  <section2 topic='Simple Challenge' anchor='protocol-simple'>
    <section3 topic='Triggering Stanza' anchor='protocol-trigger'>
      <p>A "triggering stanza" is an XMPP &MESSAGE;, &PRESENCE;, or &IQ; stanza that is deemed abusive by the receiving entity (e.g., a client) or an intermediate router (e.g., a server). The entity that generates a triggering stanza is called a "sender".</p>
      <example caption='Sender Generates Triggering Stanza'><![CDATA[

  <x xmlns='jabber:x:oob'>

  </x>
</message>
      ]]></example>
    </section3>
    <section3 topic='Challenge Stanza' anchor='protocol-challenge'>
     <p>Upon receiving a triggering stanza, an entity MAY send a "challenge stanza". An entity MUST NOT send a challenge stanza under any other circumstances. The entity that generates the challenge stanza is called the "challenger".</p>
    <p>The challange stanza consists of an XMPP &MESSAGE; stanza containing a data form for the sender to fill out, formatted according to &xep0004;, optionally along with a &BODY; and other elements. The following rules apply to the challenge stanza.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The challenge stanza MUST include an 'id' attribute set to the challenge ID (i.e., a unique identifier for this challenge within the challenger's application).</li>
      <li>The challenge stanza SHOULD include a &BODY; element that provides an explanation of the challenge for clients that do not yet support CAPTCHA forms.</li>
      <li>The challenge stanza MAY include a URL (typically a Web page with instructions) using &xep0066; as an alternative for clients that do not yet support CAPTCHA forms.</li>
      <li>The 'xml:lang' attribute of the challenge stanza SHOULD be the same as the one received from the sender, if any.</li>
      <li>The challenge stanza MUST include a CAPTCHA form, i.e., a data form of type "form" containing one or more challenges. <note>Inclusion of a CAPTCHA form not only makes it possible to flexibly support or require a large number of challenge types, but also enables constrained clients to respond to challenges (e.g., mobile phone clients that cannot present web pages, or clients on XMPP-only networks).</note></li>
      <li>The CAPTCHA form MUST include a hidden field named "FORM_TYPE" (in accordance with &xep0068;) whose value MUST be "urn:xmpp:captcha".</li>
      <li>The CAPTCHA form MUST include a hidden field named "challenge" set to the challenge ID.</li>
      <li>The CAPTCHA form MUST include a hidden field named "from" set to the value of the 'to' attribute from the triggering stanza.</li>
      <li>If the triggering stanza included an 'id' attribute, then the CAPTCHA form MUST include a hidden field named "sid" set to that value.</li>
      <li>Each of the CAPTCHA form's non-hidden &lt;field/&gt; elements MAY contain a different challenge.</li>
      <li>Each CAPTCHA field MAY contain a media element (see &xep0221;) that in turn contains a pointer to media that the sender shall use in solving puzzles, performing optical character recognition, identifying audio or video samples, etc. When the sender replies to a media element via a data form of type "submit", the field type SHOULD be "text-single" (which is the default for data form fields) but MAY in turn include a media element if acceptable to the challenger application.</li>
    </ol>

<section1 topic='Challenge Types' anchor='challenge'>
  <section2 topic='Introduction' anchor='challenge-intro'>
    <p>Entities MUST address the needs of disabled people and CPU-constrained clients by offering senders a reasonable choice of different types of challenges.</p>
    <p>Desktop clients running on modern PCs will typically be configured to automatically perform a specified 'SHA-256' Hashcash challenge (see below) whenever it is below a certain level of difficulty, with the result that many people may not even notice challenges most of the time. However, people using CPU-constrained clients (e.g. Web or mobile clients) would notice the performance hit. They might prefer to take a CAPTCHA challenge instead. <note>A CPU-constrained client could ask a faster computer (e.g., its server) to perform a Hashcash challenge for it.</note></p>
    <p>Visually disabled people using a CPU-constrained client could configure their client to always present them with an audio CAPTCHA challenge.</p>
    <p>Most of the challenges below are language sensitive. However, the evaluation of the OCR and Hashcash responses does not depend on the language the sender is using.</p>
    <p>Challenge types are distinguished by the 'var' attribute of each &lt;field/&gt; element. Several types of challenges are described below. More challenges MAY be documented elsewhere and registered with the XMPP Registrar (see <link url='#registrar-formtypes'>Field Standardization</link>).</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='SHA-256 Hashcash' anchor='challenge-hashcash'>
    <p>The SHA-256 Hashcash challenge is transparent to average PC users. It is indicated when the value of the 'var' attribute is 'SHA-256'. It forces clients to perform CPU-intensive work, making it difficult to send large amounts of abusive traffic. This significantly reduces abusive traffic, but alone it will not completely stop abusive stanzas from being sent through large collections of 'zombie' computers. <note>The hope is that the extra CPU usage will often be noticed by the owners of the zombie machines, who will be more likely to fix them.</note></p>
    <p>The challenger MUST set the 'label' attribute of the &lt;field/&gt; element to a hexadecimal random number containing a configured number of bits (e.g., 2<span class='super'>20</span> &#8804; label &lt; 2<span class='super'>21</span>).</p>
    <p>To pass the test, the sender MUST return a text string that starts with the JID the sender sent the first stanza to (i.e., the stanza that triggered the challenge). The least significant bits of the SHA-256 hash (see &nistfips180-2;) of the string MUST equal the hexadecimal value specified by the challenger (in the 'label' attribute of the &lt;field/&gt; element). For example, if the 'label' attribute is the 20-bit value 'e03d7' then the following string would be correct:</p>
    <code>innocent@victim.com2450F06C173B05E3</code>
    <p>Note: When configuring the number of bits to be specified by a challenger in the 'label' attribute values, administrators MUST balance the need to make mass abuse as difficult as possible, with the inconvenience that may be caused to the users of less powerful computers. (Most clients will be challenged only very occasionally, so the consumption of 70% of a typical desktop CPU for 4 seconds might be considered appropriate.) Administrators SHOULD increment the configured number of bits from time to time to match increases in the performance of typical desktop PCs. If an administrator notices that abusive robots never attempt the Hashcash challenge, then he SHOULD consider reducing the number of bits, to avoid inconveniencing people unnecessarily.</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='CAPTCHAs' anchor='challenge-captcha'>
    <p>Note: It may be profitable to send abusive stanzas even if less than one percent of CAPTCHA responses are successful. The effectiveness of a CAPTCHA challenge needs to be close to perfect, unless it is used in combination with other anti-abuse techniques.</p>
    <p>If a media type is specified (see table below) then the &lt;field/&gt; element MUST contain a &lt;media/&gt; element that includes a &lt;uri/&gt; element of that type. Clients that support the CAPTCHA type MUST be able to play or render the specified MIME-types (see table below). They MAY also support other formats. <note>Audio CAPTCHAs typically require challengers to provide at least the 'audio/x-wav' MIME-type (with the PCM codec) because more efficient patent-free formats are often not supported by constrained clients. It is RECOMMENDED that challengers provide more compact formats (like Ogg Speex or MP3) too.</note></p>
    <p>The 'type' attribute of the &lt;field/&gt; element SHOULD be 'text-single', 'text-private', or 'text-multi' (if no 'type' is specified, the default is 'text-single'). <note>The 'boolean' and 'list-single' field types would make it trivial for a robot to provide a correct response at least some of the time.</note> The response MUST be provided in the language specified by the 'xml:lang' attribute of the challenge stanza.</p>

<section1 topic='Question and Answer for Legacy Clients' anchor='legacy'>
  <p>A challenger MAY provide a text question in the &BODY; element of a challenge stanza for clients that do not support CAPTCHA forms. Entities that cannot serve <cite>Out-of-Band Data</cite> URLs MAY use this option to challenge legacy clients.</p>
  <!-- It also allows entities to provide a challenge for minimal legacy clients that do not support <cite>Out-of-Band Data</cite> URLs (these don't exist). -->
  <p>Note: Robots always attempt the easiest challenge they are offered. So the question MUST be at least as difficult for a robot as the CAPTCHA form.</p>
  <p>Note: Even if it provides a text question in the &BODY; element, a challenger MUST always provide a CAPTCHA form.</p>

<section1 topic='Discontinuation Policy' anchor='stop'>
  <p>It is RECOMMENDED that entities employ other techniques to combat abusive stanzas in addition to those described in this document (e.g., see <cite>XEP-0161</cite> and &xep0205;).</p>
  <p>It is expected that this protocol will be an important and successful tool for discouraging abusive traffic. However, much of its success is dependent on the quality of the CAPTCHAs and other puzzles employed by a particular implementation.</p>
  <p>The administrator of an application that functions as a challenger SHOULD discontinue the use of CAPTCHA forms under the following circumstances:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If he realises that the challenger's challenges are largely ineffective in combating abusive traffic, and that the reduction in abuse does not compensate for the inconvenience to humans of responding to the challenger's challenges.</li>
    <li>If other, <em>more transparent</em>, techniques being employed by the challenger are so successful that challenges are offering only negligible additional protection against abusive traffic.</li>
    <li>If the challenger needs no protection at all because it receives only a negligible amount of abusive traffic.</li>
  </ul>
</section1>

<section1 topic='Internationalization Considerations' anchor='i18n'>
  <p>Each form field SHOULD include a 'label' attribute. If the sender did not include an 'xml:lang' attribute, then the challenger may not know the correct language for the labels. Therefore, depending on user preferences, the client that receives a challenge MAY present generic but localized text instead of label text that would not be understood by the user. Suggested generic text (to be suitably localized) is provided by <link url='#table-1'>Table 1</link> in the <link url='#challenge-captcha'>CAPTCHAs</link> section of this document.</p>
</section1>

<section1 topic='Security Considerations' anchor='sec'>
  <p>The use of CAPTCHAs is not a panacea, and should be combined with other anti-abuse mechanisms, such as those described in <cite>XEP-0161</cite> and <cite>XEP-0205</cite>. For example, the task of finding solutions to CAPTCHAs and other computational puzzles is becoming easier for computer programs, and in any case can be farmed out to third parties. Therefore challengers should limit the number of triggering stanzas (e.g., registration attempts, subscription requests, or chatroom joins) allowed per JabberID or IP address during any given time period, and may simply refuse repeated stanzas by terminating an XML stream with a &policy; stream error or returning a &notacceptable; stanza error as appropriate. In addition, a challenger should feel free to deploy additional anti-abuse mechanisms as needed.</p>
