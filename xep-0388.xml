<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>While SASL provides an excellent framework that has served us well over the past 18 years, a number of shortcomings in the profile - the syntax binding to XMPP - that is in use.</p>
  <p>This specification addresses a number of shortfalls:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Number of round trips</li>
    <li>Extensibility</li>
    <li>Support for second factor</li>
    <li>Support for mandatory password changes</li>
    <li>Support for algorithm upgrades</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The new SASL profile documented herein is primarily a syntactic change to allow extensibility, combined with removal of the (largely) redundant stream restart, and additional results beyond total success or abject failure, as well as an upgrade path for different SCRAM hashes.</p>
  <section2 topic="Terminology">
    <p>Although initiating entities, in general, use SASL, and receiving entities offer it, the SASL specification and common parlance both use "Client " and "Server"; this specification uses Client and Server and assumes C2S links. This is not intended to preclude use of this SASL profile on S2S links. The term "SASL2" is used to mean the new SASL profile specified in this document; however the same RFC 4422 definition of SASL (and SASL profiles) applies.</p>
    <p>Examples often use hypothetical SASL mechanisms and sub-extensions; this specification does not intend to make a position on any particular SASL mechanism, and the Mandatory To Implement mechanisms are unaffected.</p>
  </section2>
</section1>

<section1 topic='Overview' anchor="overview">
  <section2 topic="SASL mechanism negotiation" anchor="feature">
    <p>Clients capable of SASL2 MUST send the desired bare JID they want to authenticate for in the "from" attribute of the stream-header unless they don't know it (e.g. when using the GSS-API SASL mechanism etc.) according to section 4.7.1 of &rfc6120;. Providing the bare JID saves one round-trip.</p>
    <p>Servers capable of SASL2 offer a stream feature of &lt;authentication/>, qualified by the "urn:xmpp:sasl:2" namespace. This in turn contains one or more &lt;mechanism/> elements in the same namespace, and potentially other elements (for example, the &lt;hostname/> element defined within &xep0233;). The mechanism elements MUST only offer mechanisms the server can offer for the JID provided by the client in the "from" attribute of the stream-header. If that atrribute is omitted or does not contain a recognised bare JID, the server SHOULD only offer mechanisms it can provide independently of the JID. Note that varying responses based on whether an account exists or not may leak the existence of accounts to unauthorized parties. See the security considerations section for more information.</p>
    <p>The &lt;authentication/> element MAY contain a list of &lt;upgrade/> elements each containing a string value of a possible SASL mechanism the client can perform an upgrade task for. If multiple mechanisms differ only in their support for channel-binding (e.g. SCRAM's -PLUS variants), implementations MUST use only the names of variants without channel-binding for the &lt;upgrade/> elements, because mechanism upgrades are independent of any channel-binding.</p>
    <p>The feature so advertised, and its child content, SHOULD be stable for the given stream to and from attributes and encryption state, and therefore MAY be cached by clients for later connections.</p>
    <p>Note that SASL2 is impossible for clients to initiate without at least one mechanism being available, and therefore MUST NOT be offered if not at least one mechanism can be provided.</p>
    <p>The Service Name used by XMPP is unchanged from &rfc6120;.</p>
    <p>All servers and clients supporting channel-binding MUST implement &xep0440;.</p>
    <p>Additional stream features that can be negotiated as part of a successful SASL authentication can be included in the &lt;inline/> element.</p>

  </section2>
  <section2 topic="SASL Data Encoding">
    <p>In all cases, both Clients and Servers encode SASL exchanges using Base 64 encoding. This SHOULD NOT include any line wrapping or other whitespace. As the form &lt;element/> is equivalent to &lt;element>&lt;/element>, these both indicate an empty string. Challenges and responses with no data do not occur in SASL, and so require no special handling. To indicate the absence of an initial response, or the absence of success data, the element is simply not included.</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic="Initiation" anchor="initiation">
    <p>Clients, upon observing this stream feature, initiate the authentication by the use of the &lt;authenticate/> top-level element within the same namespace. The nature of this element is to inform the server about properties of the final stream state, as well as initiate authentication itself and possibly ask for an upgrade task for the server-supported SASL mechanisms. To achieve this, it has a single mandatory attribute of "mechanism", with a string value of a mechanism name offered by the Server in the stream feature, an optional attribute of "upgrade", with a string value of a mechanism offered by the Server in an &lt;upgrade/> element in the stream feature, and an optional child element of &lt;initial-response/>, containing a base64-encoded SASL Initial Response. If the "mechanism" or "upgrade" attributes contain a string not previously announced by the server in in the stream feature, the server MUST fail the authentication.</p>
    <p>If the stream's from attribute (if present) does not match the non-empty authorization string, the server MUST fail the authentication.</p>
    <p>Clients SHOULD also include a &lt;user-agent/> element, informing the server about the connecting client. The 'id' attribute is RECOMMENDED, and if present it contains a unique stable identifier for the client installation. This allows the server to provide functionality such as deriving stable resource identifiers (see &xep0386;). The child elements &lt;software/> and &lt;device/> contain text descriptions of the client software and the device it is installed on. These allow the server to keep the user informed about what devices are connected to their account. Servers MUST NOT expose this information to other entities (such functionality is available in &xep0092; if required).</p>
    <example caption="An authentication request"><![CDATA[
<authenticate xmlns='urn:xmpp:sasl:2' mechanism="SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS" upgrade="SCRAM-SHA-256">

    <device>Kiva's Phone</device>
  </user-agent>
</authenticate>
]]></example>
    <p>In order to provide support for other desired stream states beyond authentication, additional child elements are used. For example, a hypothetical XEP-0198 session resumption element might be included, and/or Resource Binding requests.</p>
    <example caption="An authentication request with a (hypothetical) bind request, but without an upgrade attribute"><![CDATA[

</authenticate>
]]></example>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic="During Authentication">
    <p>At any time while authentication is in progress, neither Client nor Server sends any element (including stanzas) or other data except the top-level elements defined herein. Clients MUST NOT send whitespace, and MUST send only &lt;response/> elements as appropriate or an &lt;abort/> element to immediately cause an error. Servers MUST disconnect Clients immediately if any other traffic is received. Servers are similarly REQUIRED to send no whitespace, and only the &lt;response/> and completion elements from the section below.</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic="Challenges and Responses" anchor="challenge">
    <p>Server Challenges MAY then be sent. Each Challenge MUST be responded to by a Client in a Client Response. These are not extensible, and contain the corresponding base64 encoded SASL data:</p>

  <section2 topic="Completing Authentication" anchor="outcome">
    <p>Authentication may complete in one of three ways. It may complete successfully, in which case the client is authenticated. It may also fail, in which case the client is not authenticated and the stream and session state remain entirely unchanged.</p>
    <p>Finally, it may have completed successfully, but further interaction is required - for example, a password change or second-factor authentication. If the client specified an "upgrade" attribute in its &lt;authenticate/> element, the server MUST send a &lt;continue/> element containing the task the client needs to perform for the upgrade to succeed.</p>
    <section3 topic="Success" anchor="success">
      <p>If the Client is now authenticated, the Server sends a &lt;success/> element, which contains an &lt;authorization-identity/> element containing the negotiated identity - this is a bare JID, unless resource binding has occurred, in which case it is a full JID.</p>
      <p>If the &lt;success/> element it the response to a SASL mechanism exchange, it MAY contain an &lt;additional-data> element, containing additional data from the SASL mechanism that has just completed.</p>
      <p>If the &lt;success/> element is the response to a task exchange <link url="#continue">initiated by a &lt;continue/> element</link>, it MAY contain any other element defined in a future protocol containing additional data from the task that has just completed</p>

      <p>A &lt;failure/> element is used by the server to terminate the authentication attempt. It MAY contain application-specific error codes, and MAY contain a textual error. It MUST contain one of the SASL error codes from RFC 6120 Section 6.5.</p>

      <p>Such tasks are presented within a &lt;tasks> element, which contains a sequence of &lt;task> elements, each containing a name. These tasks are analogous to a SASL mechanism, but have a number of differences - they may never attempt to negotiate a new authorization identifier, nor a new security layer.</p>
      <p>Like the &lt;success/> element, the &lt;continue/> element MAY contain an &lt;additional-data/> element containing additional data from the SASL mechanism that has completed.</p>
      <p>A client MAY choose any one of the offered tasks; if multiple are required a sequence of &lt;continue> exchanges will occur until all mandatory tasks are complete.</p>

      <p>After the final octet of the first &lt;continue> element, any SASL security layer negotiated in the preceding exchange SHALL be immediately in effect.</p>
      <p>Clients respond with a &lt;next/> element, which has a single mandatory attribute of "task", containing the selected task name, and MAY contain any other element defined in a future protocol defining this task.</p>
      <p>The concrete elements exchanged for each task after the &lt;next/> have to be defined in a future protocol defining a concrete task. Each task MUST end either by the server sending a &lt;failure/> element, if the task failed, a &lt;continue/> element, if the task was completed successfully and the server requests the client to perform a new task, or a &lt;success/> element, indicating that the task was completed successfully and no further tasks are needed.</p>

    <p>In order to upgrade the Server's database to include the needed data for new SASL mechanisms, the client indicated the desired SASL mechanism to upgrade in its &lt;authenticate/> element as specified in <link url="#initiation">Initiation</link>.

This task MUST be the only task provided in this &lt;continue/> element and, for security reasons, the upgrade task MUST be the last task the server requires.
    This task has a prefix of "UPGR-" followed by the SASL mechanism name to upgrade to.</p>
    <p>The client then initiates this upgrade task by providing a corresponding &lt;next/> element providing the task name.
    Upon receiving the &lt;next/> element for the upgrade, the server provides the elements and data needed for the client to calculate the requested data. The concrete elements and exchanges needed for the upgrade task have to be defined in a future protocol.</p>

  <p>For compatibility purposes, the server SHOULD keep the older authentication data (password hashes etc.) of all configured mechanisms to continue offering the same mechanisms as before.</p>

<section1 topic='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>
  <p>Relative to the SASL profile documented in RFC 6120, this introduces more data unprotected by any security layer negotiated by SASL itself.</p>
  <p>While no actual exchanges are introduced that are unprotected, the nature of this exchange might allow for (for example) a resource binding extension to be introduced.</p>
  <p>SASL security layers are sparingly used in the field, however, so this is thought to be a theoretical, rather than practical, concern.</p>
  <p>As explained in § 13.8.3 of &rfc6120;, servers and clients SHOULD NOT support SASL PLAIN unless it is required by the authentication backend. Usage of PLAIN allows for trivial downgrade atacks by Man-In-The-Middle attackers circumventing any possible channel-binding or mutual authentication and even allowing the attacker to gain access to the cleartext password. If possible, PLAIN should be disabled by default on servers and clients and only be enabled when configured by the admin respective client user (if at all).</p>
  <p>This protocol allows the client to provide a hint of its identity prior to authentication. This value MUST NOT be trusted to contain the real identity of the connecting client. Varying pre-authentication responses (such as supported SASL mechanisms) based on this value may allow unauthorized parties to discover whether an account exists, and even guess at what software might be used with that account (e.g. by observing whether the client has upgraded to specific mechanisms). Minimizing differences between the default response for unregistered JIDs and registered JIDs, as well as rate-limiting (to prevent enumeration attempts), are possible countermeasures. If the server does not know the client-identity it is RECOMMENDED to randomize the list of provided SASL mechanisms to reduce these risks even further.</p>

    <p>Although the unrealistic 2FA here uses 2 round-trips (real ones will probably use one), the embedding of resource binding as shown here means that a second RTT is saved by SASL2, and there's no net change.
