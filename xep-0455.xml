<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>The XMPP Network is a network of servers which each have their own administration policies, status reports, and other peculiarities. &xep0157; provides a consistent framework for reaching out to administrators and reporting abuse, incidents, or even giving feedback on the service, and the goal of this specification is to provide a similar framework for letting users (or other entities) know the server status in-band or out of band (in case of hard failures).</p>
  <p>Centralized systems usually control both the infrastructure and client code, making it easy to hardcode information retrieval one way or the other.</p>
  <p>The usual way of informing users of planned maintenance, partial or total outage was previously through "announce" modules that lets the admin broadcast server-wided messages. This approach has several drawbacks, as it will appear in most clients as a new discussion with the server JID, which can prove confusing. It also does not provide a way to reach the user when the XMPP server is offline.</p>
    <p>This XEP provides:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>An informational way of exposing an external service endpoint containing machine-readable data using &xep0128;</li>
        <li>A specification of the data this service should provide</li>
        <li>A normative way of providing such information in-band, when the outage is not complete</li>
        <li>A way to reference and archive such incidents, in a &xep0060; node</li>
    </ul>
</section1>
<section1 topic='External status' anchor='external-status'>
  <section2 topic='Discovery' anchor='external-disco'>
    <p>To make such discovery possible, we specify a &xep0128; mechanism that a server SHOULD return in response to service discovery information ("disco#info") requests sent to the bare domain of the server. This information MUST be scoped using a FORM_TYPE of "urn:xmpp:sos:0" (as already specified in &xep0128;) and data form fields registered for this purpose as defined in the <link url='#registrar'>XMPP Registrar Considerations</link> section of this document.</p>

    <p>Values of 'external-status-addresses' form field MUST be valid URIs, i.e. comply with the 'xs:anyURI' datatype of &w3xmlschema2;.</p>
    <example caption='Entity queries server for information'><![CDATA[
<iq from='thirdwitch@shakespeare.lit/chamber'
    to='shakespeare.lit'
    id='disco1'
    type='get'>
  <query xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/disco#info'/>
</iq>
]]></example>

    <example caption='Server communicates information'><![CDATA[
<iq from='shakespeare.lit'
    to='thirdwitch@shakespeare.list/chamber'
    id='disco1'
    type='result'>
  <query xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/disco#info'>
    <identity category='server' type='im'/>
    <feature var='http://jabber.org/protocol/disco'/>
    <x xmlns='jabber:x:data' type='result'>
      <field var='FORM_TYPE' type='hidden'>
        <value>urn:xmpp:sos:0</value>
      </field>
      <field var='external-status-addresses'>
        <value>http://secondary.shakespeare.lit/status.json</value>
      </field>
    </x>
  </query>
</iq>
]]></example>

    <p>Links present inside the 'external-status-addresses' field SHOULD use HTTP/HTTPS protocol and the resources referenced MUST be available without authentication.</p>

  </section2>
  <section2 topic='External status format' anchor='json-schema'>
    <p>The format used for the external status is defined here, to allow a wide range
       of compatibility across services and clients.</p>
    <p>A client MUST ignore unknown extra fields present in the JSON file, to allow extensibility, and implementations MAY add other fields.</p>
    <example caption='Example status'><![CDATA[
{
  "planned": true,
  "beginning": "2021-01-12T01:01:01Z",
  "expected_end": "2021-01-12T05:00:00Z",
  "message": {
    "default": "Mise à jour du serveur",
    "en": "The serveur is being updated"
  }
}
  ]]></example>

    <p>The "message" field, when set, MUST contain at least a message on the "default" key
        which will be used by clients if the current user language is not found. It is left
        to the operator to determine which language is more relevant as a default, according
        to the server’s user base.</p>

    <p>When the outage is over, the file SHOULD be replaced with an empty JSON object.</p>

    <example caption='Empty file after resolution of the issue'><![CDATA[
{}
]]></example>

    <p>The following JSON schema is provided as a means to describe and validate the
       file exposed by the external service:</p>

    <code><![CDATA[
{
  "$id": "http://xmpp.org/server-outage-schema.json",
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",

<section1 topic='Use Cases' anchor='usecases'>
  <p>This extension has been thought for several different cases of service outages:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A client failing to connect to a server is able to display an informative message to the user if the server is having issues.</li>
    <li>A server experiencing difficulties is able to communicate it to the users, and clients can display the information prominently.</li>
    <li>An external service can keep track of the various outages, either for a single server or a number of them, and present the information in a structured manner.</li>
  </ul>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Business Rules' anchor='rules'>
  <p>A client implementing this extension MUST fetch the addresses of the external service and cache it
    for later use. Doing so allows the client to use this information when it is impossible to connect
    to the server.</p>
  <p>A client receiving an outage event for a time in the future SHOULD treat it as a planned event
     that is not already happening and adapt its display consequently.</p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Internationalization Considerations' anchor='i18n'>
  <p>Both the JSON and the XML format defined in this document allow for internationalization in the fields that are expected to be presented to the user as-is. The other fields are machine-readable and their various values SHOULD be translated in the implementing applications.</p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>
  <p>Client implementations MUST check the provenance of the pubsub notifications before displaying a notification, otherwise malicious entities could send fake outage events.</p>
  <p>Server administrators MUST ensure the servers provided in 'external-status-addresses' are trusted, as malicious administrators of this server could use the referenced file
     to display arbitrary messages to users.</p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='IANA Considerations' anchor='iana'>
  <p>This document requires no interaction with &IANA;.</p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='XMPP Registrar Considerations' anchor='registrar'>
  <p>The &REGISTRAR; includes the following information in its registries.</p>
  <section2 topic='Field Standardization' anchor='registrar-formtype'>
    <p>&xep0068; defines a process for standardizing the fields used within Data Forms qualified by a particular namespace, and &xep0128; describes how to use field standardization in the context of service discovery. This section registers fields for server information scoped by the "urn:xmpp:sos:0" FORM_TYPE.</p>
