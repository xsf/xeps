<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>It is a common desire for a user using XMPP for IM to want to store their messages in a central archive
  on their server. This feature allows them to record conversations that take place on clients that do not
  support local history storage, and also to synchronise their conversation history seamlessly between
  multiple clients.</p>
</section1>

<section1 topic='Requirements' anchor='requirements'>
  <p>As this extension aims to make things easy for client developers, some research was made into the
  way clients handle history today. The resulting protocol was designed to allow for the following primary
  usage scenarios:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Automatic history synchronization between multiple clients.</li>
    <li>Calendar-based on-demand display of historic messages in a client that doesn't keep local history.</li>
    <li>So-called 'infinite' scrollback, whereby a client automatically fetches and displays historic messages
    naturally in the message log as the user scrolls back in time.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Another extension for archiving already exists in XMPP, &xep0136;). However implementation experience has
  shown that the protocol defined therein supports rather more functionality than is typically needed for the
  above uses, and is significantly more effort to implement.</p>
  <p>This specification aims to define a much simpler and modular protocol for working with a server-side
  message store. Through this it is hoped to boost implementation and deployment of archiving in XMPP. It
  should be noted that (although not required) a server is free to implement XEP-0136 alongside this
  protocol if it so chooses, though a mapping between both protocols is beyond the scope of this specification.</p>
  <p>Notable functionality in XEP-0136 that is intentionally not defined by this specification for simplicity:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Support for 'collections'. Few clients even support this concept for local history storage, and
    it is possible to apply the logic for splitting a stream of messages into conversations on the
    client-side, thus greatly simplifying the protocol.</li>
    <li>Support for uploading to the archive. On the assumption that a server automatically archives
    messages to and from the client, it is typically rare for a client to end up with messages that are
    not already in the archive. Uploading could be useful for bootstrapping an empty archive however, and
    may be defined in a future specification if there is demand for such functionality.</li>
    <li>Support for 'off the record' chats (OTR; not to be confused with the encryption algorithm of
    the same name). This allowed complex negotiation for either the user or contact to command specific
    conversations to bypass the archive. In reality the archiving behaviour of a contact's server cannot
    be enforced (they could ignore the OTR request and archive the messages anyway without your consent)
    so this specification does not try and regulate that. Equivalent functionality can be implemented with
    server logic for not including encrypted or specially-tagged messages in the archive (out of scope for
    this specification).</li>
    <li>Support per-session configuration. This feature was deemed unnecessary for the majority of
    implementations, and hence the configuration protocol in this specification is much simplified,
    which allows for a simple user interface in clients. Advanced configuration however may be performed
    through ad-hoc commands depending on the server implementation.</li>
  </ul>
</section1>

<section1 topic='Message archives' anchor='archives'>
        <p>An archive is a collection of messages stored on a user's server. Messages sent to or from a
        user's account are generally automatically added to a user's archive by the server. The collection
        is ordered chronologically by the time each message was sent/received.</p>
        <p>Exactly which messages a server archives is left up to implementation and deployment policy,
        but as a minimum servers SHOULD NOT archive messages that do not have a &lt;body/&gt; child tag.</p>
        <p>A stored message consists of at least the following pieces of information:</p>
        <ul>
                <li>A timestamp of when the message was sent (for an outgoing message) or received (for
                an incoming message).</li>
                <li>The remote JID that the stanza is to (for an outgoing message) or from (for an
                incoming message).</li>
                <li>A server-assigned UID that MUST be unpredictable and unique within the archive.</li>
                <li>The message stanza itself. The entire original stanza SHOULD be stored, but at a
                minimum only the &lt;body/&gt; tag MUST be preserved (ie. the server might, at its
                discretion, strip certain extensions from messages before storage).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A server MAY impose limits on the size of a user's archive. For example a server might begin
        to discard old messages once the archive reaches a certain size, or only keep messages until they
        reach a certain age. The UIDs of deleted messages MUST NOT be reused for new messages.</p>
        <p>There is no restriction on where an archive may be hosted. Servers that archive
        messages on behalf of local users SHOULD expose archives to the user on the user's bare JID, while a
        MUC service might allow MAM queries to be sent to the room's bare JID.</p>
        <section2 topic='Archiving messages'>
          <p>When an incoming message is archived, the server SHOULD add an &lt;archived/&gt; element to the message,
            which informs the client of where the message is stored. The element MUST contain a 'by' attribute
            giving the JID of the archive (i.e. where the client would send queries to) and an 'id' attribute
            giving the message's UID within the archive.</p>
          <p>Servers MUST NOT include the &lt;archived/&gt; element in messages addressed to JIDs that do not
            have permission to access the archive, such as a user's outgoing messages to their contacts.</p>
          <example caption='Client receives a message that has been archived'><![CDATA[
<message to='juliet@capulet.lit/balcony'
  from='romeo@montague.lit/orchard'
  type='chat'>
  <body>Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized; Henceforth I never will be Romeo.</body>
  <archived by='juliet@capulet.lit' id='28482-98726-73623' />
</message>
]]></example>
        <p>Naturally a message might be archived in multiple places, and include multiple &lt;archived/&gt;
          elements with different 'by' attributes. Clients MUST be prepared to handle this situation, and
          MUST ignore additional elements with 'by' attributes from entities they don't recognise, or that have
          not been determined to have MAM support (see <link url='#support'>Determining support</link>). Archiving
          servers supporting MAM MUST strip any existing &lt;archived/&gt; element with a 'by' attribute equal to
          an archive that they provide.</p>
        </section2>
</section1>

<section1 topic='Querying the archive' anchor='query'>
        <p>A client is able to query the archive for all messages within a certain timespan, optionally
        restricting results to those to/from a particular JID. To allow limiting the results or paging
        through them a client may use &xep0059;, which MUST be supported by servers.</p>
        <p>A query consists of an &lt;iq/&gt; stanza addressed to the account or server entity hosting
        the archive, with a 'query' payload. On receiving the query, the server pushes to the client a
        series of messages from the archive that match the client's given criteria, and finally returns
        the &lt;iq/&gt; result.</p>
    <example caption='Querying the archive for messages'><![CDATA[
<iq type='get' id='juliet1'>
  <query xmlns='urn:xmpp:mam:tmp' queryid='f27' />
</iq>

[... server sends matching messages ...]

<iq type='result' id='juliet1'/>
    ]]></example>
  <p>To ensure that the client knows when the results are complete, the server MUST delay the result
  &lt;iq/&gt; until after it has pushed all the results to the client. An optional 'queryid' attribute
  allows the client to match results to a certain query.</p>
  <section2 topic='Filtering results' anchor='filter'>
    <p>By default all messages match a query, and filters are used to request a subset of the archived
    messages. The query can contain any combination of three filtering tags - &lt;with/&gt;, &lt;start/&gt;
    and &lt;end/&gt;. However each of these tags MUST NOT be specified more than once in a query.</p>
    <section3 topic='Filtering by JID' anchor='filter-jid'>
      <p>If a &lt;with/&gt; element is present in the &lt;query/&gt;, it contains a JID against which
      to match messages. The server MUST only return messages if they match the supplied JID.</p>
      <p>If &lt;with/&gt; is omitted, the server SHOULD return all messages in the selected timespan,
      regardless of the to/from addresses on each message.</p>
    <example caption='Querying for all messages to/from a particular JID'><![CDATA[
<iq type='get' id='juliet1'>
  <query xmlns='urn:xmpp:mam:tmp'>
    <with>juliet@capulet.lit</with>
  </query>
</iq>
    ]]></example>
    <p>If (and only if) the supplied JID is a bare JID (i.e. no resource is present), then
    the server SHOULD return messages if their bare to/from address would match it. For example,
    if the client supplies a 'with' of "juliet@capulet.lit" the query would also match messages to
    or from "juliet@capulet.lit/balcony" and "juliet@capulet.lit/chamber".</p>
    </section3>
    <section3 topic='Filtering by time received' anchor='filter-time'>
      <p>The &lt;start/&gt; and &lt;end/&gt; elements, if provided, MUST contain timestamps
      formatted according to the DateTime profile defined in &xep0082;</p>
      <p>The &lt;start/&gt; element is used to filter out messages before a certain date/time.
      If specified, a server MUST only return messages whose timestamp is equal to or later
      than the given timestamp.</p>
      <p>If omitted, the server SHOULD assume the value of &lt;start/&gt; to be equal to the
      date/time of the earliest message stored in the archive.</p>
      <p>Conversely, the &lt;end/&gt; element is used to exclude from the results messages
      after a certain point in time. If specified, a server MUST only return messages whose
      timestamp is equal to or earlier than the timestamp given in the &lt;end/&gt; element.</p>
      <p>If omitted, the server SHOULD assume the value of &lt;end/&gt; to be equal to the
      date/time of the most recent message stored in the archive.</p>
      <example caption='Querying the archive for all messages in a certain timespan'><![CDATA[
<iq type='get' id='juliet1'>
  <query xmlns='urn:xmpp:mam:tmp'>
      <start>2010-06-07T00:00:00Z</start>
      <end>2010-07-07T13:23:54Z</end>
  </query>
</iq>
    ]]></example>  
      <example caption='Querying the archive for all messages after a certain time'><![CDATA[
<iq type='get' id='juliet1'>
  <query xmlns='urn:xmpp:mam:tmp'>
    <start>2010-08-07T00:00:00Z</start>
  </query>
</iq>
    ]]></example>
    </section3>
    <section3 topic='Limiting results' anchor='query-limit'>
      <p>Finally, in order for the client or server to limit the number of results transmitted at
      a time a server MUST support &xep0059; and SHOULD support the paging mechanism defined therein.
      A client MAY include a &lt;set/&gt; element in its query.</p>
      <p>For the purposes of this protocol, the UIDs used by RSM correspond with the UIDs of the
      stanzas stored in the archive.</p>
      <example caption='A query using Result Set Management'><![CDATA[
<iq type='get' id='q29302'>
  <query xmlns='urn:xmpp:mam:tmp'>
      <start>2010-08-07T00:00:00Z</start>
      <set xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/rsm'>
         <max>10</max>
      </set>
  </query>
</iq>
    ]]></example>
    <p>To conserve resources, a server MAY place a reasonable limit on how many stanzas may be
    pushed to a client in one request. If a query returns a number of stanzas greater than this
    limit and the client did not specify a limit using RSM then the server should return
    a policy-violation error to the client.
    
    <example caption='Server responds to client that requests too many results without RSM'><![CDATA[
<iq type='error' id='q29302'>
  <error type='modify'>
    <policy-violation xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-stanzas'/>
    <text xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-stanzas'>Too many results</text>
  </error>
</iq>
    ]]></example>
    If the query did include a &lt;set/&gt; element then the server SHOULD simply return
    its limited results and in its &lt;iq&gt; result adjust the &lt;before/&gt; and
    &lt;after/&gt; to reflect the timestamps of the first and last message it is returning
    to the client. This allows clients to page through results by timestamp.</p>
    <p>The result response MUST also include an RSM &lt;set/&gt; element indicating the
      UID of the first and last message of the (possibly limited) result set. This
      allows clients to accurately page through messages.
    </p>
    <example caption='Server responds to client with limited results using RSM'><![CDATA[
<iq type='result' id='q29302'>
  <query xmlns='urn:xmpp:mam:tmp'>
    <start>2010-06-07T00:00:00Z</start>

       <last>09af3-cc343-b409f</last>
       <count>20</count>
    </set>
  </query>
</iq>
    ]]></example>
    <p>The &lt;first&gt; and &lt;last&gt; elements specify the UID of the first and last returned
    results (not of the results that matched the query).</p>
    
    <p>The RSM &lt;count&gt; element and the 'index' attribute on the RSM &lt;first&gt; element are optional,
    but servers SHOULD include them. Please refer to the RSM specification for more information
    surrounding their meaning and use.</p>
    </section3>
    <section3 topic='Paging through results' anchor='query-paging'>
      <p>Having previously made a query that returned results limited by the server (as described above), a client
      can re-send the same request and receive the next 'page' of results. It does this by including a &lt;set&gt;
      element with its request, containing an &lt;after/&gt; with the UID of the last message it received
      from the previous query.</p>
      <example caption='A page query using Result Set Management'><![CDATA[
<iq type='get' id='q29303'>
  <query xmlns='urn:xmpp:mam:tmp'>
      <start>2010-08-07T00:00:00Z</start>

      </set>

</iq>
    ]]></example>
    <p>Note: There is no concept of an "open query", and servers MUST be prepared to receive arbitrary page requests at any time.</p>
    </section3>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Query results' anchor='results'>
    <p>The server responds to the archive query by transmitting to the client all the messages
       that match the criteria the client requested. The results are sent as individual stanzas,
       with the original message encapsulated in a &lt;forwarded/&gt; element as described in &xep0297;.
    </p>
    <p>The result messages MUST contain a &lt;result/&gt; element with an 'id' attribute that gives
       the current message's archive UID. If the client gave a 'queryid' attribute in its initial
       query, the server MUST also include that in this result element.
    </p>
    <p>The &lt;result/&gt; element contains a &lt;forwarded/&gt; element which SHOULD contain the
       original message as it was received, and SHOULD also contain a &lt;delay/&gt; element
       qualified by the 'urn:xmpp:delay' namespace specified in &xep0203;. The value of the 'stamp'
       attribute MUST be the time the message was originally received by the forwarding entity.

<section1 topic='Archiving Preferences' anchor='prefs'>
  <p>Depending on implementation and deployment policies, a server MAY allow the user to have control
  over the server's archiving behaviour. This specification defines a basic protocol for this, and
  also allows a server to offer more advanced configuration to a user.</p>
  <section2 topic='Simple configuration' anchor='config'>
    <p>If the server supports and allows configuration then it SHOULD implement the protocol defined
    in this section. This allows the user to configure the following preferences:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A list of JIDs that should always have messages to/from archived in the user's store.</li>
      <li>A list of JIDs that should never have messages to/from archived in the user's store.</li>

        <p>If a server or other entity hosts archives and supports MAM queries, it MUST advertise
          the 'urn:xmpp:mam:tmp' feature in response to &xep0030; requests made to archiving JIDs
          (i.e. JIDs hosting an archive, such as users' bare JIDs):

  <section2 topic="Spoofing of 'archived'">
    Clients and servers may receive messages containing &lt;archived/&gt; elements
    that have not been verified. If proper handling of received &lt;archived/&gt;
    elements is not followed, an attacker could disrupt a client's cache of
    archived message UIDs, and prevent the client from fetching future messages
    correctly (by using an 'id' that doesn't exist in the archive).
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Data privacy' anchor='security-privacy'>
    <p>An archive generally consists of private conversations, and so
    a server MUST adequately protect an archive from unauthorized third-party
    access. For example authorized parties for a user's archive would include
    the just the user, and a MUC archive for a private room might be restricted
    to room members. An implementation MAY choose to allow access to any archive
    by server administrators.</p>
    <p>A server SHOULD provide a mechanism for a user to disable archiving of
    messages with all or specific contacts, such as via the configuration
    protocol described in this document. This allows the user to prevent the
    archiving of potentially sensitive messages in the first place.</p>
    <p>A server MAY automatically prevent certain sensitive messages from being
    archived. How such messages are identified is beyond the scope of this
    specification, but technologies such as &xep0258; may be used, for example.</p>
