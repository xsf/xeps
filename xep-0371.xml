  <title>Jingle ICE Transport Method</title>
  <abstract>This specification defines a Jingle transport method that results in sending media data using datagram associations via the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) or using end-to-end connections via the Transport Control Protocol (TCP). This transport method is negotiated via the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) methodology (which provides robust NAT traversal for media traffic) and also supports the ability to exchange candidates throughout the life of the session, consistent with so-called "Trickle ICE" (draft-ietf-ice-trickle).</abstract>

<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>&xep0166; defines a framework for negotiating and managing out-of-band data sessions over XMPP. In order to provide a flexible framework, the base Jingle specification defines neither data transport methods nor application formats, leaving that up to separate specifications.</p>
  <p>The current document defines a transport method for establishing and managing data exchanges between XMPP entities by means of the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) methodology specified in &rfc8445;. The Jingle usage of ICE was also the first technology to send ICE candidates incrementally, a technique that has since become known as "Trickle ICE" &trickle;.</p>
  <p>The process for ICE negotiation is largely the same in Jingle as it is in &rfc8445;. There are several differences:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Instead of using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) as the signalling channel, Jingle uses XMPP as the signalling channel.</li>
    <li>Syntax from the Session Description Protocol (see &rfc4566;) is mapped to an XML syntax suitable for sending over the XMPP signalling channel.</li>
    <li>In Jingle, lists of "preferred" candidates are typically sent in the Jingle session-initiate and session-accept messages, in a way that is consistent with the SDP offer / answer model described in &rfc3264; and the process described in &rfc8445;.</li>
    <li>Candidates can also be sent in separate transport-info messages either before sending or receiving the session-accept message (to expedite negotiation) or after media begins to flow (to find modify existing candidates, find superior candidates, or adjust to changing network conditions). This usage, which has been part of the Jingle ICE transport method since 2005, has since come to be known as "Trickle ICE"; as defined here the usage is consistent with the IETF specification for Trickle ICE &trickle;.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As originally defined in XEP-0166 and then &xep0176; the use of ICE in Jingle applied only to negotiations that established a User Datagram Protocol association (see &rfc0768;) and thus resulted in a Jingle datagram transport suitable for media applications where some packet loss is tolerable (e.g., audio and video). However, since the publication of &rfc6544; in 2012 it has also been possible to exchange Transmission Control Protocol (see &rfc0793;) candidates during ICE negotiation. Therefore this document expands the use of ICE in Jingle to also establish a TCP connection and thus result in a Jingle stream transport suitable for media applications where packet loss cannot be tolerated (e.g., file transfer). To reduce the possibility of confusion, the expanded definition provided here is specified in a new XEP, which is intended to supersede XEP-0176.</p>

<section1 topic='Glossary' anchor='terms'>
  <p>The reader is referred to &rfc8445; and draft-ietf-ice-trickle for a description of various terms used in the context of ICE. Those terms are not reproduced here.</p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Requirements' anchor='reqs'>
  <p>The Jingle transport method defined herein is designed to meet the following requirements:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Make it possible to establish and manage out-of-band connections between two XMPP entities, even if they are behind Network Address Translators (NATs) or firewalls.</li>
    <li>Enable use of UDP or TCP as the transport protocol.</li>
    <li>Make it relatively easy to implement support in standard Jabber/XMPP clients.</li>
    <li>Where communication with non-XMPP entities is needed, push as much complexity as possible onto server-side gateways between the XMPP network and the non-XMPP network.</li>
  </ol>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Jingle Conformance' anchor='conformance'>
   <p>In accordance with Section 10 of &xep0166;, this document specifies the following information related to the Jingle ICE transport method:</p>
   <ol>
     <li><p>The transport negotiation process is defined in the <link url='#protocol'>Protocol Description</link> section of this document.</p></li>
     <li><p>The semantics of the &TRANSPORT; element are defined in the <link url='#protocol-negotiate'>ICE Negotiation</link> section of this document.</p></li>
     <li><p>Depending on the kinds of candidates exchanged, successful negotiation of this method results in use of a datagram transport (suitable for applications where some packet loss is tolerable, such as audio and video) or of a streaming transport (suitable for applications where packet loss is not tolerable, such as file transfer).</p></li>
     <li><p>If multiple components are to be communicated by the application type that uses the transport, the transport shall support those components and assign identifiers for them as described in the specification that defines the application type.</p></li>

  <section2 topic='Session Initiation' anchor='protocol-initiate'>
    <p>In order for the initiator in a Jingle exchange to start the negotiation, it sends a Jingle "session-initiate" stanza that includes at least one content type, as described in &xep0166;. If the initiator wishes to negotiate the ICE transport method for an application format, it MUST include a &TRANSPORT; child element qualified by the 'urn:xmpp:jingle:transports:ice:0' namespace &VNOTE;. This element SHOULD in turn contain one &CANDIDATE; element for each of the initiator's higher-priority transport candidates as determined in accordance with the ICE methodology, but MAY instead be empty (with each candidate to be sent as the payload of a transport-info message).</p>

  <section2 topic='Candidate Negotiation' anchor='protocol-candidates'>
    <p>The initiator and responder negotiate connectivity over ICE by exchanging XML-formatted transport candidates for the channel. This negotiation proceeds immediately in order to maximize the possibility that connectivity can be established (and therefore media can be exchanged) as quickly as possible. In order to expedite session establishment, the initiator SHOULD include transport candidates in its session-initiate message but MAY also send additional transport candidates as soon as it learns of them, even before receiving the IQ-result that acknowledges the session-initiate message (i.e., the initiator MUST consider the session to be live as soon as it sends the session-initiate message). <note>Given in-order delivery as mandated by &xmppcore;, the responder will receive such transport-info messages after receiving the session-initiate message; if not, it is appropriate for the responder to return &lt;unknown-session/&gt; errors since according to its state machine the session does not exist.</note></p>
    <p>The first step in negotiating connectivity is for each party to send transport candidates to the other party. <note>The fact that both parties send candidates means that Jingle requires each party to be a full implementation of ICE, not a lite implementation as specified in &rfc8445;.</note> These candidates SHOULD be gathered by following the procedure specified in Section 5.1.1 of &rfc8445; (typically by communicating with a standalone STUN server in order to discover the client's public IP address and port) and prioritized by following the procedure specified in Section 5.1.2 of &rfc8445;.</p>
      <p>Each candidate shall be sent as a &lt;candidate/&gt; child of a &TRANSPORT; element qualified by the 'urn:xmpp:jingle:transports:ice:0' namespace. The &TRANSPORT; element is sent via a Jingle message of type session-initiate, session-accept, or transport-info.</p>
      <p>Either party MAY include multiple &lt;candidate/&gt; elements in one &TRANSPORT; element, especially in the session-initiate and session-accept messages sent at the beginning of the session negotiation. Including multiple candidates in the session-initiate and session-accept messages can help to ensure interoperability with entities that implement the SDP offer/answer model described in &rfc3264;; in particular, an entity SHOULD include multiple candidates in its session-initiate or session-accept message if the other party advertises support for the "urn:ietf:rfc:3264" service discovery feature as described in the <link url='#support-sdp'>SDP Offer / Answer Support</link> section of this document. However, including one candidate per subsequent transport-info message typically results in a faster negotiation because the candidates most likely to succeed are sent first (in the session-info and session-accept messages) and it is not necessary to gather all candidates before beginning to send any candidates; furthermore, because certain candidates can be more "expensive" in terms of bandwidth or processing power, either party might not want to advertise the existence of such candidates unless it is necessary to do so after other candidates have failed.</p>
      <p>If the party that receives a candidate in a Jingle message can successfully process a given candidate or set of candidates, it returns an IQ-result (if not, for example because the candidate data is improperly formatted, it returns an IQ-error). At this point, the receiving entity is only indicating receipt of the candidate or set of candidates, not telling the other party that the candidate will be used.</p>
      <p>The initiator can keep sending candidates (without stopping to receive an acknowledgement of receipt from the responder for each candidate) until it has exhausted its supply of possible or desirable transport candidates. The responder can also keep sending potential candidates, which the initiator will acknowledge.</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Connectivity Checks' anchor='protocol-checks'>
    <p>As the initiator and responder receive candidates, they probe the candidates for connectivity. In performing these connectivity checks, each party SHOULD follow the procedure specified in Section 7 of &rfc8445;. The following business rules apply:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Each party sends a STUN Binding Request (see &rfc5389;) from each local candidate it generated to each remote candidate it received.</li>
      <li>In accordance with &rfc8445;, the STUN Binding Requests MUST include the PRIORITY attribute (computed according to Section 7.1.2.1. of &rfc8445;).</li>
      <li>For the purposes of the Jingle ICE Transport Method, both parties are full ICE implementations and therefore the controlling role MUST be assumed by the initiator and the controlled role MUST be assumed by the responder.</li>
      <li>The STUN Binding Requests generated by the initiator MAY include the USE-CANDIDATE attribute to indicate that the initiator wishes to cease checks for this component.</li>
      <li>The STUN Binding Requests generated by the initiator MUST include the ICE-CONTROLLING attribute.</li>
      <li>The STUN Binding Requests generated by the responder MUST include the ICE-CONTROLLED attribute.</li>
      <li>The parties MUST use STUN short term credentials to authenticate requests and perform message integrity checks. As in &rfc8445;, the username in the STUN Binding Request is of the form "ufrag-of-peer:ufrag-of-sender" and the password is the value of the 'pwd' attribute provided by the peer. <note>Thus when Romeo sends a STUN Binding Request to Juliet the credentials will be STUN username "9uB6:8hhy" (ufrag provided by Juliet concatenated with ufrag provided by Romeo) and password "YH75Fviy6338Vbrhrlp8Yh" (pwd provided by Juliet) whereas when Juliet sends a STUN Binding Request to Romeo the credentials will be STUN username "8hhy:9uB6" (ufrag provided by Romeo concatenated with ufrag provided by Juliet) and password "asd88fgpdd777uzjYhagZg" (pwd provided by Romeo).</note></li>
    </ol>
    <p>When it receives a STUN Binding Request, each party MUST return a STUN Binding Response, which indicates either an error case or the success case. As described in Section 7.2.5.3 of &rfc8445;, a connectivity check succeeds if <em>all</em> of the following are true:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The Binding request generated a success response.</li>
      <li>The source and destination transport addresses in the Binding request and response are symmetric.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For the candidates exchanged in the previous section, the connectivity checks would be as follows (this diagram mirrors the example from section 15.1 of &rfc8445;).</p>

    <p>Note: aggressive nomination described in RFC 5245 is not used anymore in the updated &rfc8445;. From now on the initiator MUST nominate just one valid candidate pair.</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='End-of-Candidates Indication' anchor='protocol-end'>
    <p>As explained in the Trickle ICE specification, when a party has completed gathering of ICE candidates it will send an "end-of-candidates indication" to the other party. In Jingle, this takes the form of an informational message as described under <link url='#info'>Informational Messages</link>. This specificaton defines only a standalone "end-of-candidates indication" (i.e., not a way to indicate ICE completion in an offer or answer).</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Acceptance of Successful Candidate' anchor='protocol-acceptance'>
    <p>If, based on STUN connectivity checks, the parties determine that they will be able to exchange media (i.e., each component has "nominated" candidate pair and ICE processing is "completed"), they proceed with optional remote-candidate notification after which ICE transport is considered to be established. By this moment the parties may exchange media data already since it's allowed even before the candidate pairs nomination according to &rfc8445;</p>
    <p>Once the parties have connectivity and therefore the initiator has completed ICE for the media stream as explained in &rfc8445;, the initiator MAY communicate the in-use (nominated) candidate pairs in the signalling channel by sending a transport-info message that contains a &lt;remote-candidate/&gt; element for each component of the data stream (this maps to the SDP "remote-candidates" attribute as described in Appendix B of draft-ietf-mmusic-ice-sip-sdp specification, i.e., remote candidates are "the actual candidates at R that were selected by the offerer").</p>
    <p>Note, while in SIP this message is MUST it's just MAY for XMPP. The difference comes from a SIP problem (offer updates) which doesn't exist in XMPP. Basically there is no <strong>transport-info</strong> or any other message which represents candidates of a valid pair and therefore the race condition is not possible. Even so if the responder advertises "urn:ietf:rfc:3264" disco feature and hence may serve as a Jingle-to-SIP proxy the message MUST be sent.</p>

    <p>At any time, either party MAY restart the process of ICE negotiation by sending a candidate with a 'generation' value that is greater than the previous generation of candidates; when it does so, it MUST generate new values for the 'pwd' and 'ufrag' attributes, consistent with the definition of an ICE restart in Section 9 of &rfc8445; (because an ICE restart is signalled by a change in the 'pwd' and 'ufrag' attributes, strictly speaking the 'generation' attribute is not absolutely necessary). As explained in &rfc8445;, typically the ICE negotiation would be restarted to change the media target (e.g., an IP address change for one of the parties) and certain third-party-call-control scenarios.</p>

    <p>Note: If a party has already sent ICE restart and receives any transport-info message before &lt;iq/&gt; stanza of type "result", the transport-info messages have to be acknowledged with &lt;iq/&gt; stanzas of type "result" but dropped afterwards. After the restart was acknowledged, the other party MAY send the same candidates again as a part of the new ICE session. It's also possible both parties will send ICE restart simultaneously. In this case session initiator MUST respond with &lt;tie-break/&gt; error (see &xep0166;).</p>

<section1 topic='Fallback to Raw UDP' anchor='fallback'>
  <p>It can happen that the responder does not support ICE, in which case it can be necessary to fall back to use of the &xep0177;. One typical scenario is communication between an ICE-aware Jingle endpoint and a non-ICE-aware SIP endpoint through a Jingle-to-SIP gateway, as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The Jingle endpoint sends a session-initiate request to the SIP endpoint, specifying a transport method of ICE.</li>
    <li>Based on capabilities information, the gateway knows that the SIP endpoint does not support ICE, so it enables the endpoints to use its media relay. It does this by:
      <ul>
        <li>Sending a transport-replace message to the Jingle endpoint on behalf of the SIP endpoint, specifying a transport method of Raw UDP and a candidate whose IP address and port are hosted at the gateway.</li>
        <li>Sending SIP INVITE to the SIP endpoint on behalf of the Jingle endpoint, speciying an IP address and port at the gateway.</li>
      </ul>

<section1 topic='Implementation Notes' anchor='impl'>
  <p>In order to speed the negotiation process so that media can flow as quickly as possible, the initiator SHOULD gather and prioritize candidates in advance, or as soon as the principal begins the process of initiating a session.</p>
</section1>

<section1 topic='Deployment Notes' anchor='deploy'>
  <p>This specification applies exclusively to Jingle clients and places no additional requirements on XMPP servers. However, service administrators might wish to deploy a STUN server in order to ease the client-to-client negotiation process and a TURN server for media relaying (see &turn;). Deployment of support for &xep0215; might also be helpful.</p>

<section1 topic='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>
  <section2 topic='Sharing IP Addresses' anchor='security-sharing'>
    <p>By definition, the exchange of transport candidates results in exposure of the sender's IP addresses, which comprise a form of personally identifying information. A Jingle client MUST enable a user to control which entities will be allowed to receive such information. If a human user explicitly accepts a session request, then the client SHOULD consider that action to imply approval of IP address sharing. However, waiting for a human user to explicitly accept the session request can result in delays during session setup, since it is more efficient to immediately begin sharing transport candidates. Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED for the client to immediately send transport candidates to a contact (without waiting for explicit user approval of the session request) in the following cases:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The user has permanently and formally authorized the contact to view the user's presence information via a presence subscription as reflected in an XMPP roster item (see &xmppim;).</li>
      <li>The user has temporarily and dynamically shared presence with the contact via "directed presence" as described in &rfc3921;.</li>
      <li>The user has explicitly added the contact to a list of entities who are allowed to access the user's personally-identifying information.</li>
    </ol>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Encryption of Media' anchor='security-media'>
    <p>A Jingle implementation SHOULD support security preconditions that are enforced before application media is allowed to flow over a UDP association, such as those described in &xtls;.</p>
    <p>Application types that use the Jingle ICE transport method MAY also define their own application-specific encryption methods, such as the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) for RTP exchanges as described in &xep0167;.</p>

  <section2 topic='Protocol Namespaces' anchor='registrar-ns'>
    <p>This specification defines the following XML namespace:</p>
    <ul>

    </ul>
    <p>The &REGISTRAR; includes the foregoing namespace in its registry at &NAMESPACES;, as governed by &xep0053;.</p>

    <p>If an entity supports the SDP offer / answer model described in &rfc3264; and therefore prefers to receive one transport-info message with multiple candidates, it MUST advertise support for the "urn:ietf:rfc:3264" feature.</p>
    <p>The registry submission is as follows.</p>
