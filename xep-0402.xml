    <section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
        <p>The original Bookmarks specification (&xep0048;) used the widely available
            Private XML Storage (&xep0049;), but stored all bookmarks in a single element.
            When the specification was moved to the Standards Track and Draft, it was also
            updated to use the user's Pubsub service (&xep0223;), but kept this single element
            containing all bookmarks inside a single Pubsub item.</p>
        <p>Most implementations have kept to the original, Private XML Storage based solution, and
            while some newer implementations have used Pubsub, these are limited in capability by the use of
            a single item.</p>
        <p>This specification resolves both issues by providing a new Bookmarks specification to migrate to,
            and takes the opportunity to update the XML namespace in use as well. The URL storage is dropped,
            since it is rarely used. Storage of URL bookmarks is therefore out of scope.</p>
    </section1>

    <section1 topic="Outline of use">
        <p>Clients store each bookmarked chatroom as a Pubsub item within the '&namespace;' node. Each
            item SHALL have, as item id, the Room JID of the chatroom (eg, coven@chat.shakespeare.lit).</p>
        <p>The payload of the item SHALL be a conference element qualified by the '&namespace;' namespace, with the following syntax:</p>

        <p>Note also that a conference element has no truly mandatory attributes or child elements, thus the following is legal:</p>

        <section2 topic='Registering to notifications' anchor='enable-updates'>
            <p>A client interested in bookmarks SHOULD include the 'urn:xmpp:bookmarks:0+notify' feature in its &xep0115;, as per &xep0163;, so that it receives notifications for updates done by other clients of the user, and react accordingly.  The actual notifications are explained in the <link url='#notifications'>Bookmark Notifications</link> section of this specification.</p>

            <p>Once connected, a client first retrieves the current list of bookmarks.  It then SHOULD join every MUC identified by the items’ 'id' attribute that have an 'autojoin' attribute that is set to "true" or "1".</p>

            <p>Adding a bookmark means publishing a new item, with the bookmark JID as id, to the '&namespace;' node.</p>
            <p>publish-options (as defined in <link url='https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.xml#publisher-publish-options'>XEP-0060</link>) MUST be supported by the server in order to check that the node is correctly configured before publishing a new conference.  This is especially important to avoid leaking your bookmarks to your contacts for instance.</p>

            <p>This implies that server support for the "delete-items" pubsub feature is REQUIRED.</p>
            <p>A 'notify' attribute SHOULD be included on the &lt;retract/&gt; element in order to inform other online clients of the deletion.</p>

        <p>When a client is sent an event from the Pubsub service for the '&namespace;' node, it SHOULD join the room immediately if the 'autojoin' attribute is both present and true.</p>

            <p>A server that supports unifying bookmarks from &xep0049; and &xep0402; SHOULD announce the "urn:xmpp:bookmarks:0#compat" feature on the account.

    <section1 topic="Acknowledgements">

        <p>The client needs to make sure that the server actually supports the "http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub#publish-options" feature, before relying on it. If it's not supported, the client should configure the '&namespace;' node first (see <cite>xep-0060</cite>), before adding any bookmarks.</p>
