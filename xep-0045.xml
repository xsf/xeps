  <title>Multi-User Chat</title>
  <abstract>This specification defines an XMPP protocol extension for multi-user text chat, whereby multiple XMPP users can exchange messages in the context of a room or channel, similar to Internet Relay Chat (IRC). In addition to standard chatroom features such as room topics and invitations, the protocol defines a strong room control model, including the ability to kick and ban users, to name room moderators and administrators, to require membership or passwords in order to join the room, etc.</abstract>

      <ul>
        <li>Clarified the fact that room roles and affiliations are shortcuts to bundles of privileges.</li>
        <li>Removed references to service discovery feature for "gc-1.0" since it is now obsolete.</li>
        <li>Added security consideration about information leaks related to service discovery.</li>
        <li>Corrected some examples of presence and message errors so that the 'from' and 'to' addresses are merely swapped, in accordance with RFC 6120; also added 'by' attribute to show that the room itself generated the error.</li>
        <li>Added 'nick' attribute to &lt;actor/&gt; element so that an action can be attributed either to a real JID or to a roomnick.</li>
        <li>Clarified the meaning of status code 100.</li>
        <li>Corrected delayed delivery text and examples so that the 'from' address is that of the room.</li>
        <li>Added 'id' attributes to most examples, especially message and presence stanzas generated by the room since IDs can be used for tracking purposes and ghost detection.</li>
        <li>Added term "Occupant JID" to differentiate between the JID of a &lt;room@service&gt; and the JID of a &lt;room@service/nick&gt;.</li>
        <li>Added "muc#maxhistoryfetch" form field.</li>
        <li>Loosened handling of room joins when nicks are locked down, so that the service should modify the roomnick instead of returning an error.</li>
        <li>Specified that the room must return a room subject, even if the subject is empty.</li>
        <li>Removed feature for requesting a unique room name (the client can simply use a UUID).</li>
        <li>Removed any mention of fully-anonymous rooms, which are not supported by this specification.</li>
        <li>Clarified many small points in the text and examples.</li>

<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>Traditionally, instant messaging is thought to consist of one-to-one chat rather than many-to-many chat, which is called variously "groupchat" or "text conferencing". Groupchat functionality is familiar from systems such as Internet Relay Chat (IRC) and the chatroom functionality offered by popular consumer IM services. The Jabber/XMPP community developed and implemented a basic groupchat protocol as long ago as 1999. That "groupchat 1.0" (GC) protocol provided a minimal feature set for chat rooms but was rather limited in scope. This specification (Multi-User Chat or MUC) builds on the older groupchat 1.0 protocol in a backwards-compatible manner but provides advanced features such as invitations, room moderation and administration, and specialized room types.</p>
</section1>

<section1 topic='Scope' anchor='scope'>
  <p>This document addresses common requirements related to configuration of, participation in, and administration of individual text-based conference rooms. All of the requirements addressed herein apply at the level of the individual room and are "common" in the sense that they have been widely discussed within the Jabber/XMPP community or are familiar from existing text-based conference environments (e.g., Internet Relay Chat as defined in &rfc1459; and its successors: &rfc2810;, &rfc2811;, &rfc2812;, &rfc2813;).</p>
  <p>This document explicitly does <em>not</em> address the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Relationships between rooms (e.g., hierarchies of rooms)</li>
    <li>Management of multi-user chat services (e.g., managing permissions across an entire service or registering a global room nickname); such use cases are specified in &xep0133;</li>
    <li>Moderation of individual messages</li>
    <li>Encryption of messages sent through a room</li>
    <li>Advanced features such as attaching files to a room, integrating whiteboards, and using MUC rooms as a way to manage the signalling for multi-user audio or video conferencing (see &xep0272;)</li>
    <li>Interaction between MUC deployments and foreign chat systems (e.g., gateways to IRC or to legacy IM systems)</li>
    <li>Mirroring or replication of rooms among multiple MUC deployments</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This limited scope is not meant to disparage such topics, which are of inherent interest; however, it is meant to focus the discussion in this document and to present a comprehensible protocol that can be implemented by client and component developers alike. Future specifications might address the topics mentioned above.</p>
</section1>

<section1 topic='Requirements' anchor='reqs'>
  <p>This document addresses the minimal functionality provided by Jabber-based multi-user chat services that existed in 2002 when development of MUC began. For the sake of backwards-compatibility, this document uses the original groupchat 1.0 protocol for this baseline functionality, with the result that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Each room is identified as &ROOMJID; (e.g., &lt;jdev@conference.jabber.org&gt;), where "room" is the name of the room and "service" is the hostname at which the multi-user chat service is running.</li>
    <li>Each occupant in a room is identified as &OCCUPANTJID;, where "nick" is the room nickname of the occupant as specified on entering the room or subsequently changed during the occupant's visit.</li>
    <li>A user enters a room (i.e., becomes an occupant) by sending directed presence to &OCCUPANTJID;.</li>
    <li>An occupant can change his or her room nickname and availability status within the room by sending presence information to &lt;room@service/newnick&gt;.</li>
    <li>Messages sent within multi-user chat rooms are of a special type "groupchat" and are addressed to the room itself (room@service), then reflected to all occupants.</li>
    <li>An occupant exits a room by sending presence of type "unavailable" to its current &OCCUPANTJID;.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The additional features and functionality addressed in MUC include the following:</p>
  <ol start='1'>
    <li>native conversation logging (no in-room bot required)</li>
    <li>enabling users to request membership in a room</li>
    <li>enabling occupants to view an occupant's full JID in a non-anonymous room</li>
    <li>enabling moderators to view an occupant's full JID in a semi-anonymous room</li>
    <li>allowing only moderators to change the room subject</li>
    <li>enabling moderators to kick participants and visitors from the room</li>
    <li>enabling moderators to grant and revoke voice (i.e., the privilege to speak) in a moderated room, and to manage the voice list</li>
    <li>enabling admins to grant and revoke moderator status, and to manage the moderator list</li>
    <li>enabling admins to ban users from the room, and to manage the ban list</li>
    <li>enabling admins to grant and revoke membership privileges, and to manage the member list for a members-only room</li>
    <li>enabling owners to configure various room parameters (e.g., limiting the number of occupants)</li>
    <li>enabling owners to specify other owners</li>
    <li>enabling owners to grant and revoke admin status, and to manage the admin list</li>
    <li>enabling owners to destroy the room</li>
  </ol>
  <p>In addition, this document provides protocol elements for supporting the following room types:</p>
  <ol start='1'>
    <li>public vs. hidden</li>
    <li>persistent vs. temporary</li>
    <li>password-protected vs. unsecured</li>
    <li>members-only vs. open</li>
    <li>moderated vs. unmoderated</li>
    <li>non-anonymous vs. semi-anonymous</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The extensions needed to implement these requirements are qualified by the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc' namespace (and the #owner, #admin, and #user fragments on the main namespace URI).</p>

<section1 topic='Roles, Affiliations, and Privileges' anchor='associations'>
  <p>A user might be allowed to perform any number of actions in a room, from joining or sending a message to changing configuration options or destroying the room altogether. We call each permitted action a "privilege". There are two ways we might structure privileges:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Define each privilege atomically and explicitly define each user's particular privileges; this is flexible but can be confusing to manage.</p></li>
    <li><p>Define bundles of privileges that are generally applicable and assign a user-friendly "shortcut" to each bundle (e.g., "moderator" or "admin").</p></li>
  </ol>
  <p>MUC takes the second approach.</p>
  <p>MUC also defines two different associations: long-lived affiliations and session-specific roles. These two association types are distinct from each other in MUC, since an affiliation lasts across visits, while a role lasts only for the duration of a visit. In addition, there is no one-to-one correspondence between roles and affiliations; for example, someone who is not affiliated with a room may be a (temporary) moderator, and a member may be a participant or a visitor in a moderated room. These concepts are explained more fully below.</p>
  <section2 topic='Roles' anchor='roles'>
    <p>The following roles are defined:</p>
    <table caption='Roles'>
      <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Support</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Moderator</td>
        <td>REQUIRED</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>None</td>
        <td>N/A (the absence of a role)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Participant</td>
        <td>REQUIRED</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Visitor</td>
        <td>RECOMMENDED</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Roles are temporary in that they do not necessarily persist across a user's visits to the room and MAY change during the course of an occupant's visit to the room. An implementation MAY persist roles across visits and SHOULD do so for moderated rooms (since the distinction between visitor and participant is critical to the functioning of a moderated room).</p>
    <p>There is no one-to-one mapping between roles and affiliations (e.g., a member could be a participant or a visitor).</p>
    <p>A moderator is the most powerful role within the context of the room, and can to some extent manage other occupants' roles in the room. A participant has fewer privileges than a moderator, although he or she always has the right to speak. A visitor is a more restricted role within the context of a moderated room, since visitors are not allowed to send messages to all occupants (depending on room configuration, it is even possible that visitors' presence will not be broadcasted to the room).</p>
    <p>Roles are granted, revoked, and maintained based on the occupant's room nickname or full JID rather than bare JID. The privileges associated with these roles, as well as the actions that trigger changes in roles, are defined below.</p>
    <p>Information about roles MUST be sent in all presence stanzas generated or reflected by the room and thus sent to occupants (if the room is configured to broadcast presence for a given role).</p>
    <section3 topic='Privileges' anchor='roles-priv'>
      <p>For the most part, roles exist in a hierarchy. For instance, a participant can do anything a visitor can do, and a moderator can do anything a participant can do. Each role has all the privileges possessed by the next-lowest role, plus additional privileges; these privileges are specified in the following table as defaults (an implementation MAY provide configuration options that override these defaults).</p>
      <table caption='Privileges Associated With Roles'>

      <p>The ways in which an occupant's role changes are well-defined. Sometimes the change results from the occupant's own action (e.g., entering or exiting the room), whereas sometimes the change results from an action taken by a moderator, admin, or owner.

      <p>* A moderator MUST NOT be able to revoke moderator status from an occupant who is equal to or above the moderator in the hierarchy of affiliations.</p>
      <p class='box'>Note: Certain roles are typically implicit in certain affiliations. For example, an admin or owner is automatically a moderator, so if an occupant is granted an affiliation of admin then the occupant will by that fact be granted a role of moderator; similarly, when an occupant is granted an affiliation of member in a moderated room, the occupant automatically has a role of participant. However, the loss of the admin affiliation does not necessarily mean that the occupant no longer has a role of moderator (since a "mere" occupant can be a moderator). Therefore, the role that is gained when an occupant is granted a certain affiliation is stable, whereas the role that is lost when an occupant loses a certain affilitation is not hardcoded and is left up to the implementation.</p>
    </section3>

  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Affiliations' anchor='affil'>
    <p>The following affiliations are defined:</p>
    <ol start='1'>
      <li>Owner</li>
      <li>Admin</li>
      <li>Member</li>
      <li>Outcast</li>
      <li>None (the absence of an affiliation)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Support for the owner affiliation is REQUIRED. Support for the admin, member, and outcast affiliations is RECOMMENDED. (The "None" affiliation is the absence of an affiliation.)</p>
    <p>These affiliations are long-lived in that they persist across a user's visits to the room and are not affected by happenings in the room. In addition, there is no one-to-one mapping between these affiliations and an occupant's role within the room. Affiliations are granted, revoked, and maintained based on the user's bare JID, not the nick (and thus implicitly the full JID) as with roles.</p>
    <p>If a user without a defined affiliation enters a room, the user's affiliation is defined as "none"; however, this affiliation does not persist across visits (i.e., a service does not maintain a "none list" across visits).</p>
    <p>The member affiliation provides a way for a room owner or admin to specify a "whitelist" of users who are allowed to enter a members-only room. When a member enters a members-only room, his or her affiliation does not change, no matter what his or her role is. The member affiliation also provides a way for users to register with an open room and thus be lastingly associated with that room in some way (e.g., the user's nickname is reserved in the room).</p>
    <p>An outcast is a user who has been banned from a room and who is not allowed to enter the room.</p>
    <p>Information about affiliations MUST be sent in all presence stanzas generated or reflected by the room and sent to occupants (if the room is configured to broadcast presence from entities with a given role).</p>
    <section3 topic='Privileges' anchor='affil-priv'>
      <p>For the most part, affiliations exist in a hierarchy. For instance, an owner can do anything an admin can do, and an admin can do anything a member can do. Each affiliation has all the privileges possessed by the next-lowest affiliation, plus additional privileges; these privileges are specified in the following table.</p>
      <table caption='Privileges Associated With Affiliations'>

<section1 topic='Occupant Use Cases' anchor='user'>
  <p>The main actor in a multi-user chat environment is the occupant, who can be said to be located "in" a multi-user chat room and to participate in the discussions held in that room (for the purposes of this specification, participants and visitors are considered to be "mere" occupants, since they possess no admin status). As will become clear, the protocol elements proposed in this document to fulfill the occupant use cases fall into three categories:</p>
  <ol start='1'>
    <li><p>the basic functionality for joining a room, exchanging messages with all occupants, etc. (supported by the groupchat 1.0 protocol that preceded MUC)</p></li>
    <li><p>straightforward additions to the basic functionality, such as handling of errors related to new room types</p></li>
    <li><p>additional protocol elements to handle functionality not covered by groupchat 1.0 (room invites, room passwords, extended presence related to room roles and affiliations); these are qualified by the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#user' namespace</p></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Note: All client-generated examples herein are presented from the perspective of the service, with the result that all stanzas received by a service contain a 'from' attribute corresponding to the sender's full JID as added by a normal XMPP router or session manager. In addition, normal IQ result stanzas sent upon successful completion of a request (as required by &xmppcore;) are not shown.</p>
  <section2 topic='Order of Events' anchor='order'>
    <p>The order of events involved in joining a room needs to be consistent so that clients can know which events to expect when. After a client sends presence to join a room, the MUC service MUST send it events in the following order:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>In-room presence from other occupants</li>
      <li>In-room presence from the joining entity itself (so-called "self-presence")</li>
      <li>Room history (if any)</li>
      <li>The room subject (if any)</li>
      <li>Live messages, presence updates, new user joins, etc.</li>
    </ol>
  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Entering a Room' anchor='enter'>
    <section3 topic='Groupchat 1.0 Protocol' anchor='enter-gc'>
      <p>In order to participate in the discussions held in a multi-user chat room, a user MUST first become an occupant by entering the room. In the old groupchat 1.0 protocol, this was done by sending presence with no 'type' attribute to &OCCUPANTJID;, where "room" is the room ID, "service" is the hostname of the chat service, and "nick" is the user's desired nickname within the room:</p>
      <example caption='User Seeks to Enter a Room (groupchat 1.0)'><![CDATA[

      <p>In this example, a user with a full JID of "hag66@shakespeare.lit/pda" has requested to enter the room "coven" on the "chat.shakespeare.lit" chat service with a room nickname of "thirdwitch".</p>
      <p>If the user does not specify a room nickname, the service MUST return a &badjid; error:</p>

    <section3 topic='Basic MUC Protocol' anchor='enter-muc'>
      <p>Compliant multi-user chat services MUST accept the foregoing as a request to enter a room from any client that knows either the groupchat 1.0 protocol or the multi-user chat (MUC) protocol; however, MUC clients SHOULD signal their ability to speak the MUC protocol by including in the initial presence stanza an empty &lt;x/&gt; element qualified by the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc' namespace (note the absence of the '#user' fragment):</p>
      <example caption='User Seeks to Enter a Room (Multi-User Chat)'><![CDATA[

      <p>Before attempting to enter the room, a MUC-compliant client SHOULD first discover its reserved room nickname (if any) by following the protocol defined in the <link url='#reservednick'>Discovering Reserved Room Nickname</link> section of this document.</p>
    </section3>

    <section3 topic='Presence Broadcast' anchor='enter-pres'>
      <p>If the service is able to add the user to the room, it MUST send presence from all the existing occupants' room JIDs to the new occupant's full JID, including extended presence information about roles in a single &lt;x/&gt; element qualified by the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#user' namespace and containing an &lt;item/&gt; child with the 'role' attribute set to a value of "moderator", "participant", or "visitor", and with the 'affiliation' attribute set to a value of "owner", "admin", "member", or "none" as appropriate. <note>The &PRESENCE; element MUST NOT include more than once instance of the &X; element qualified by the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#user' namespace.</note></p>

      <p>Unless the room is configured to not broadcast presence from new occupants below a certain affiliation level (as controlled by the "muc#roomconfig_presencebroadcast" room configuration option), the service MUST also send presence from the new occupant's room JID to the full JIDs of all the occupants (including the new occupant).</p>

      <p>In this example, initial room presence is being sent from the new occupant (thirdwitch) to all occupants, including the new occupant.</p>
      <p>As shown in the last stanza, the "self-presence" sent by the room to the new user MUST include a status code of 110 so that the user knows this presence refers to itself as an occupant. This self-presence MUST NOT be sent to the new occupant until the room has sent the presence of all other occupants to the new occupant; this enables the new occupant to know when it has finished receiving the room roster.</p>
      <p>The service MAY rewrite the new occupant's roomnick (e.g., if roomnicks are locked down or based on some other policy).</p>
      <p>In particular, if roomnicks are locked down then the service MUST do one of the following.</p>
      <p>If the user has connected using a "groupchat 1.0" client (as indicated on joining the room by the lack of the MUC extension), then the service SHOULD deny the nickname change request and return a presence stanza of type "error" with a &notacceptable; error condition:</p>

      <p>If the user has connected using a MUC client (as indicated on joining the room by inclusino of the MUC extension), then the service MUST include a status code of "210" in the presence broadcast that it sends to the new occupant.</p>

      ]]></example>
      <p>Note: The order of the presence stanzas sent to the new occupant is important. The service MUST first send the complete list of the existing occupants to the new occupant and only then send the new occupant's own presence to the new occupant. This helps the client know when it has received the complete "room roster". The room SHOULD also reflect the original 'id' value, if provided in the presence stanza sent by the user.</p>
      <p>After sending the presence broadcast (and only after doing so), the service MAY then send discussion history, the room subject, live messages, presence updates, and other in-room traffic.</p>
    </section3>

    <section3 topic='Non-Anonymous Rooms' anchor='enter-nonanon'>
      <p>If the room is non-anonymous, the service MUST send the new occupant's full JID to all occupants using extended presence information in an &lt;x/&gt; element qualified by the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#user' namespace and containing an &lt;item/&gt; child with a 'jid' attribute specifying the occupant's full JID:</p>

[ ... ]
      ]]></example>
      <p>If the user is entering a room that is non-anonymous (i.e., which informs all occupants of each occupant's full JID as shown above), the service MUST warn the user by including a status code of "100" in the initial presence that the room sends to the new occupant:</p>
      <example caption="Service Sends New Occupant's Presence to New Occupant"><![CDATA[

    </section3>

    <section3 topic='Semi-Anonymous Rooms' anchor='enter-semianon'>
      <p>If the room is semi-anonymous, the service MUST send presence from the new occupant to all occupants as specified above (i.e., unless the room is configured to not broadcast presence from new occupants below a certain affiliation level as controlled by the "muc#roomconfig_presencebroadcast" room configuration option), but MUST include the new occupant's full JID only in the presence notifications it sends to occupants with a role of "moderator" and not to non-moderator occupants.</p>

    <section3 topic='Password-Protected Rooms' anchor='enter-pw'>
      <p>If the room requires a password and the user did not supply one (or the password provided is incorrect), the service MUST deny access to the room and inform the user that they are unauthorized; this is done by returning a presence stanza of type "error" specifying a &notauthorized; error:</p>

      <p>However, if the bare JID &LOCALBARE; of the present occupant matches the bare JID of the user seeking to enter the room, then the service SHOULD allow entry to the user, so that the user has two (or more) in-room "sessions" with the same roomnick, one for each resource. If a service allows more than one occupant with the same bare JID and the same room nickname, it MUST route in-room messages to all of the user's resources and allow all of the user's resources to send messages to the room; it is up to the implementation whether to route private messages to all resources or only one resource (based on presence priority or some other algorithm); however, it is RECOMMENDED to route to all resources.</p>
      <p>How nickname conflicts are determined is up to the implementation (e.g., whether the service applies a case folding routine, a stringprep profile such as Resourceprep or Nodeprep, etc.).</p>

      <p>If the room has reached its maximum number of occupants, the service SHOULD deny access to the room and inform the user of the restriction; this is done by returning a presence stanza of type "error" specifying a &unavailable; error condition:</p>
      <example caption='Service Informs User that Room Occupant Limit Has Been Reached'><![CDATA[

      <p>Alternatively, the room could kick an "idle user" in order to free up space (whether the definition of "idle user" is up to the implementation).</p>
      <p>If the room has reached its maximum number of occupants and a room admin or owner attempts to join, the room MUST allow the admin or owner to join, up to some reasonable number of additional occupants; this helps to prevent denial of service attacks caused by stuffing the room with non-admin users.</p>

    <section3 topic='Locked Room' anchor='enter-locked'>
      <p>If a user attempts to enter a room while it is "locked" (i.e., before the room creator provides an initial configuration and therefore before the room officially exists), the service MUST refuse entry and return an &notfound; error to the user:</p>

    <section3 topic='Nonexistent Room' anchor='enter-nonexistent'>
      <p>If the room does not already exist when the user seeks to enter it, the service SHOULD create it; however, this is not required, since an implementation or deployment MAY choose to restrict the privilege of creating rooms.

    </section3>

    <section3 topic='Room Logging' anchor='enter-logging'>
      <p>If the user is entering a room in which the discussions are logged to a public archive (often accessible via HTTP), the service SHOULD allow the user to enter the room but MUST also warn the user that the discussions are logged. This is done by including a status code of "170" in the initial presence that the room sends to the new occupant:</p>

    <section3 topic='Discussion History' anchor='enter-history'>
      <p>After sending initial presence as shown above, depending on local service policy or room configuration a room MAY send discussion history to the new occupant. (The room MUST NOT send any discussion history before it finishes sending room presence as specified in the <link url='#enter-pres'>Presence Broadcast</link> section of this document.) Whether such history is sent, and how many messages comprise the history, shall be determined by the chat service implementation or specific deployment depending on local service policy or room configuration.</p>

      <p>Discussion history messages MUST be stamped with &xep0203; information qualified by the 'urn:xmpp:delay' namespace to indicate that they are sent with delayed delivery and to specify the times at which they were originally sent. The 'from' attribute MUST be set to the JID of the room itself.</p>
      <p>(Note: The 'urn:xmpp:delay' namespace defined in <cite>XEP-0203</cite> supersedes the older 'jabber:x:delay' namespace defined in &xep0091;; some implementations include both formats for backward compatibility.)</p>
      <p>The service MUST send all discussion history messages before delivering the room subject and any "live" messages sent after the user enters the room.</p>
    </section3>

    <section3 topic='Managing Discussion History' anchor='enter-managehistory'>
      <p>A user might want to manage the amount of discussion history provided on entering a room (perhaps because the user is on a low-bandwidth connection or is using a small-footprint client). This is accomplished by including a &lt;history/&gt; child in the initial presence stanza sent when joining the room. There are four allowable attributes for this element:</p>
      <table caption='History Management Attributes'>
        <tr>
          <th>Attribute</th>
          <th>Datatype</th>
          <th>Meaning</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>maxchars</td>
          <td>int</td>
          <td>Limit the total number of characters in the history to "X" (where the character count is the characters of the complete XML stanzas, not only their XML character data).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>maxstanzas</td>
          <td>int</td>
          <td>Limit the total number of messages in the history to "X".</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>seconds</td>
          <td>int</td>
          <td>Send only the messages received in the last "X" seconds.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>since</td>
          <td>dateTime</td>
          <td>Send only the messages received since the UTC datetime specified (which MUST conform to the DateTime profile specified in &xep0082;).</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>The service MUST send the smallest amount of traffic that meets any combination of the above criteria, taking into account service-level and room-level defaults. The service MUST send complete message stanzas only (i.e., it MUST not literally truncate the history at a certain number of characters, but MUST send the largest number of complete stanzas that results in a number of characters less than or equal to the 'maxchars' value specified). If the client wishes to receive no history, it MUST set the 'maxchars' attribute to a value of "0" (zero).</p>
      <p>Because not all service implementations support MUC history management, a client SHOULD NOT depend on receiving only the history that it has requested.</p>
      <p>The following examples illustrate the use of this feature.</p>

  <section2 topic='Sending a Message to All Occupants' anchor='message'>
    <p>An occupant sends a message to all other occupants in the room by sending a message of type "groupchat" to the &ROOMJID; itself (a service MAY ignore or reject messages that do not have a type of "groupchat"). In a moderated room, this privilege is restricted to occupants with a role of participant or higher.</p>

    <p>If the sender has voice in the room (this is the default except in moderated rooms) and the message does not violate any service-level or room-level policies (e.g., policies regarding message content or size), the service MUST change the 'from' attribute to the sender's room JID and reflect the message out to the full JID of each occupant.</p>

    <p>If the sender is a visitor (i.e., does not have voice in a moderated room), the service MAY return a &forbidden; error to the sender and MUST NOT reflect the message to all occupants. If the sender is not an occupant of the room, the service SHOULD return a &notacceptable; error to the sender and SHOULD NOT reflect the message to all occupants; the only exception to this rule is that an implementation MAY allow users with certain privileges (e.g., a room owner, room admin, or service-level admin) to send messages to the room even if those users are not occupants.</p>

  <section2 topic='Sending a Private Message' anchor='privatemessage'>
    <p>Since each occupant has its own room JID, an occupant can send a "private message" to a selected occupant via the service by sending a message to the intended recipient's room JID. The message type SHOULD be "chat" and MUST NOT be "groupchat", but MAY be left unspecified (i.e., a normal message). This privilege is controlled by the "muc#roomconfig_allowpm" room configuration option.</p>

  <section2 topic='Changing Nickname' anchor='changenick'>
    <p>A common feature of chat rooms is the ability for an occupant to change his or her nickname within the room. In MUC this is done by sending updated presence information to the room, specifically by sending presence to a new room JID in the same room (changing only the resource identifier in the room JID).</p>
    <example caption='Occupant Changes Nickname'><![CDATA[
<presence
    from='hag66@shakespeare.lit/pda'
    id='ifd1c35'
    to='coven@chat.shakespeare.lit/oldhag'/>
    ]]></example>
    <p>The service then sends two presence stanzas to the full JID of each occupant (including the occupant who is changing his or her room nickname), one of type "unavailable" for the old nickname and one indicating availability for the new nickname.</p>
   <p>The unavailable presence MUST contain the following as extended presence information in an &lt;x/&gt; element qualified by the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#user' namespace:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The new nickname (in this case, nick='oldhag')</li>
      <li>A status code of 303</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If the user attempts to change his or her room nickname to a room nickname that is already in use by another user (or that is reserved by another user affiliated with the room, e.g., a member or owner), the service MUST deny the nickname change request and inform the user of the conflict; this is done by returning a presence stanza of type "error" specifying a &conflict; error condition:</p>

  <section2 topic='Changing Availability Status' anchor='changepres'>
    <p>In text chat systems such as IRC, one common use for changing one's room nickname is to indicate a change in one's availability (e.g., changing one's room nickname to "thirdwitch|away"). In XMPP, availability is of course noted by a change in presence (specifically the &lt;show/&gt; and &lt;status/&gt; elements), which can provide important context within a chatroom. An occupant changes availability status within the room by sending updated presence to its &OCCUPANTJID;.</p>

  <section2 topic='Inviting Another User to a Room' anchor='invite'>

    <p>There are two ways of inviting another user to a room: direct invitations and mediated invitations.</p>
    <p>Direct invitations were the original method used in the early Jabber community's "groupchat 1.0" protocol. Mediated invitations were added in Multi-User Chat as a way to handle invitations in the context of members-only rooms (so that the room could exercise control over the issuance of invitations). The existence of two different invitation methods might cause confusion among client developers. Because the room needs to be involved in the invitation process only for members-only rooms, because members-only rooms are relatively rare, and because mediated invitations do not work when &xep0016; or similar technologies are used to block communication from entities not in a user's roster, client developers are encouraged to use direct invitations for all other room types.</p>

    <section3 topic='Direct Invitation' anchor='invite-direct'>
      <p>A method for sending a direct invitation (not mediated by the room itself) is defined in &xep0249;. Sending the invitation directly can help to work around communications blocking on the part of the invitee (which might reject or discard messages from entities not in its roster).</p>
    </section3>

    <section3 topic='Mediated Invitation' anchor='invite-mediated'>
      <p>It can be useful to invite another user to a room in which one is an occupant. To send a mediated invitation, a MUC client MUST send XML of the following form to the &ROOMJID; itself (the reason is OPTIONAL and the message MUST be explicitly or implicitly of type "normal"):</p>

      </reason>

  </x>
</message>
      ]]></example>
      <p>The &ROOMJID; itself MUST then add a 'from' address to the &lt;invite/&gt; element whose value is the bare JID, full JID, or room JID of the inviter and send the invitation to the invitee specified in the 'to' address; the room SHOULD add the password if the room is password-protected):</p>

  </x>
</message>
      ]]></example>
      <p>If the room is members-only, the service MAY also add the invitee to the member list. (Note: Invitation privileges in members-only rooms SHOULD be restricted to room admins; if a member without privileges to edit the member list attempts to invite another user, the service SHOULD return a &forbidden; error to the occupant; for details, see the <link url='#modifymember'>Modifying the Member List</link> section of this document.)</p>
      <p>If the inviter supplies a non-existent JID, the room SHOULD return an &notfound; error to the inviter.</p>
      <p>The invitee MAY choose to formally decline (as opposed to ignore) the invitation; and this is something that the sender might want to be informed about. In order to decline the invitation, the invitee MUST send a message of the following form to the &ROOMJID; itself:</p>
      <example caption='Invitee Declines Invitation'><![CDATA[

      </reason>
    </decline>
  </x>
</message>
      ]]></example>
      <p>It may be wondered why the invitee does not send the decline message directly to the inviter. The main reason is that certain implementations might choose to base invitations on room JIDs rather than bare JIDs (so that, for example, an occupant could invite someone from one room to another without knowing that person's bare JID). Thus the service needs to handle both the invites and declines.</p>

  <section2 topic='Converting a One-to-One Chat Into a Multi-User Conference' anchor='continue'>
    <p>Sometimes it is desirable to convert a one-to-one chat into a multi-user conference. The process is as follows.</p>

    <p>Now the first person decides to include a third person in the discussion, so she does the following:</p>
    <ol start='1'>
      <li>Creates a new multi-user chatroom</li>
      <li>Sends history of the one-to-one chat to the room (this is purely OPTIONAL; because it might cause information leakage, the client SHOULD warn the user before doing so)</li>
      <li>Sends an invitation to the second person and the third person, including a &lt;continue/&gt; element (optionally including a 'thread' attribute).</li> 
    </ol>
    <p>Note: The new room SHOULD be non-anonymous and MAY be an instant room as specified in the <link url='#createroom-instant'>Creating an Instant Room</link> section of this document.</p>
    <p>Note: If the one-to-one chat messages included a &THREAD; element, the person who creates the room SHOULD include the ThreadID with the history messages, specify the ThreadID in the invitations as the value of the &lt;continue/&gt; element's 'thread' attribute, and include the ThreadID in any new messages sent to the room. Use of ThreadIDs is RECOMMENDED because it helps to provide continuity between the one-to-one chat and the multi-user chat.</p>

    <p>Note: Use of the <cite>Delayed Delivery</cite> protocol enables the room creator to specify the datetime of each message from the one-to-one chat history (via the 'stamp' attribute), as well as the JID of the original sender of each message (via the 'from' attribute); note well that the 'from' here is not the room itself, since the originator of the message is the delaying party. The room creator SHOULD send the complete one-to-one chat history before inviting additional users to the room, and SHOULD also send as history any messages appearing in the one-to-one chat interface after joining the room and before the second person joins the room; if the one-to-one history is especially large, the sending client might want to send the history over a few seconds rather than all at once (to avoid triggering rate limits). The service SHOULD NOT add its own delay elements (as described in the <link url='#enter-history'>Discussion History</link> section of this document) to prior chat history messages received from the room owner.</p>

    <p>An implementation MAY allow an unaffiliated user (in a moderated room, normally a participant) to register with a room; as a result, the user will become a member of the room and will have their preferred nickname reserved in the room.

In particular, it is not possible to join a members-only room without being on the member list, so an entity might need to request membership in order to join such a room.</p>
    <p>If allowed, this functionality SHOULD be implemented by enabling a user to send a request for registration requirements to the room qualified by the 'jabber:iq:register' namespace as described in &xep0077;:</p>

    <p>A user MAY have a reserved room nickname, for example through explicit room registration, database integration, or nickname "lockdown". A user SHOULD discover his or her reserved nickname before attempting to enter the room. This is done by sending a Service Discovery information request to the room JID while specifying a well-known Service Discovery node of "x-roomuser-item".</p>

    <p>It is OPTIONAL for a multi-user chat service to support the foregoing service discovery node. If the room or service does not support the foregoing service discovery node, it MUST return a &feature; error to the user. If it does and the user has a registered nickname, it MUST return the nickname to the user as the value of the 'name' attribute of a Service Discovery &lt;identity/&gt; element (for which the category/type SHOULD be "conference/text"):</p>
    <example caption="Room Returns Nickname"><![CDATA[

    <p>If the user does not have a registered nickname, the room MUST return a service discovery &QUERY; element that is empty (in accordance with <cite>XEP-0030</cite>).</p>
    <p>Even if a user has registered one room nickname, the service SHOULD allow the user to specify a different nickname on entering the room (e.g., in order to join from different client resources), although the service MAY choose to "lock down" nicknames and therefore deny entry to the user, including a &notacceptable; error. The service MUST NOT return an error to the user if his or her client sends the foregoing request after having already joined the room, but instead SHOULD reply as previously described.</p>
    <p>If another user attempts to join the room with a nickname reserved by the first user, the service MUST deny entry to the second user and return a &conflict; error as previously described.</p>
  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Requesting Voice' anchor='requestvoice'>
    <p>It is not possible for a visitor to speak (i.e., send a message to all occupants) in a moderated room. To request voice, a visitor SHOULD send a &MESSAGE; stanza containing a data form to the room itself, where the data form contains only a "muc#role" field with a value of "participant".</p>

    <p>Presence stanzas of type "unavailable" reflected by the room MUST contain extended presence information about roles and affiliations; in particular, the 'role' attribute MUST be set to a value of "none" to denote that the individual is no longer an occupant.</p>
    <p>The occupant MAY include normal &lt;status/&gt; information in the unavailable presence stanzas; this enables the occupant to provide a custom exit message if desired:</p>
    <example caption='Custom Exit Message'><![CDATA[
<presence
    from='wiccarocks@shakespeare.lit/laptop'
    to='coven@chat.shakespeare.lit/oldhag'
    type='unavailable'>
  <status>gone where the goblins go</status>
</presence>
    ]]></example>
    <p>Normal presence stanza generation rules apply as defined in &xmppim;, so that if the user sends a general unavailable presence stanza, the user's server will broadcast that stanza to the client's &OCCUPANTJID;; as a result, there is no need for the leaving client to send directed unavailable presence to its room JID. It is possible that a user might not be able to gracefully exit the room by sending unavailable presence. If the user goes offline without sending unavailable presence, the user's server is responsible for sending unavailable presence on behalf of the user (in accordance with <cite>RFC 6121</cite>).</p>
    <p>Note: See <link url='#impl-service-ghosts'>Ghost Users</link> for suggestions regarding room occupants that appear to be present in the room but that are actually offline.</p>
    <p>Note: If the room is not persistent and this occupant is the last to exit, the service is responsible for destroying the room.</p>
  </section2>

</section1>

<section1 topic='Moderator Use Cases' anchor='moderator'>
  <p>A moderator has privileges to perform certain actions within the room (e.g., to change the roles of some occupants) but does not have rights to change persistent information about affiliations (which can be changed only by an admin or owner) or the room configuration. Exactly which actions can be performed by a moderator is subject to configuration. However, for the purposes of the MUC framework, moderators are stipulated to have privileges to perform the following actions:</p>
  <ol start='1'>
    <li>discover an occupant's full JID in a semi-anonymous room (occurs automatically through presence)</li>
    <li>modify the subject</li>
    <li>kick a participant or visitor from the room</li>
    <li>grant or revoke voice in a moderated room</li>
    <li>modify the list of occupants who have voice in a moderated room</li>
  </ol>
  <p>These features are implemented with a request/response exchange using &lt;iq/&gt; elements that contain child elements qualified by the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#admin' namespace. The examples below illustrate the protocol interactions to implement the desired functionality. (Except where explicitly noted below, any of the following administrative requests MUST be denied if the &lt;user@host&gt; of the 'from' address of the request does not match the bare JID portion of one of the moderators; in this case, the service MUST return a &forbidden; error.)</p>

  <section2 topic='Modifying the Room Subject' anchor='subject-mod'>
    <p>A common feature of multi-user chat rooms is the ability to change the subject within the room.</p>
    <p>By default, only users with a role of "moderator" SHOULD be allowed to change the subject in a room (although this is configurable, with the result that a mere participant or even visitor might be allowed to change the subject, as controlled by the "muc#roomconfig_changesubject" option).</p>
    <p>The subject is changed by sending a message of type "groupchat" to the &ROOMJID;, where the &MESSAGE; MUST contain a &lt;subject/&gt; element that specifies the new subject but MUST NOT contain a &BODY; element (or a &THREAD; element). In accordance with the core definition of XMPP, other child elements are allowed (although the entity that receives them might ignore them).</p>
    <p>Note: A message with a &SUBJECT; and a &BODY; or a &SUBJECT; and a &THREAD; is a legitimate message, but it SHALL NOT be interpreted as a subject change.</p>
    <example caption='Moderator Changes Subject'><![CDATA[
<message
    from='wiccarocks@shakespeare.lit/laptop'
    id='lh2bs617'
    to='coven@chat.shakespeare.lit'
    type='groupchat'>
  <subject>Fire Burn and Cauldron Bubble!</subject>
</message>
    ]]></example>
    <p>The MUC service MUST reflect the message to all other occupants with a 'from' address equal to the room JID that corresponds to the sender of the subject change:</p>
    <example caption='Service Informs All Occupants of Subject Change'><![CDATA[
<message
    from='coven@chat.shakespeare.lit/secondwitch'

    to='crone1@shakespeare.lit/desktop'
    type='groupchat'>
  <subject>Fire Burn and Cauldron Bubble!</subject>
</message>

[ ... ]
    ]]></example>
    <p>As explained under <link url='#enter-history'></link>, when a new occupant joins the room the room SHOULD include the last subject change after the discussion history.</p>
    <p>A MUC client that receives such a message MAY choose to display an in-room message, such as the following:</p>
    <example caption='Client Displays Room Subject Change Message'><![CDATA[
* secondwitch has changed the subject to: Fire Burn and Cauldron Bubble!
    ]]></example>
    <p>If someone without appropriate privileges attempts to change the room subject, the service MUST return a message of type "error" specifying a &forbidden; error condition:</p>
    <example caption='Service Returns Error Related to Unauthorized Subject Change'><![CDATA[
<message

    ]]></example>
    <p>In order to remove the existing subject but not provide a new subject (i.e., set the subject to be empty), the client shall send an empty &lt;subject/&gt; element (i.e., either "&lt;subject/&gt;" or "&lt;subject&gt;&lt;/subject&gt;").</p>
    <example caption='Moderator Sets Empty Subject'><![CDATA[

  <section2 topic='Kicking an Occupant' anchor='kick'>
    <p>A moderator has permissions kick certain kinds of occupants from a room (which occupants are "kickable" depends on service provisioning, room configuration, and the moderator's affiliation -- see below). The kick is performed based on the occupant's room nickname and is completed by setting the role of a participant or visitor to a value of "none".</p>
    <example caption='Moderator Kicks Occupant'><![CDATA[

      <reason>Avaunt, you cullion!</reason>
    </item>
  </query>
</iq>
    ]]></example>
    <p>The service MUST remove the kicked occupant by sending a presence stanza of type "unavailable" to each kicked occupant, including status code 307 in the extended presence information, optionally along with the reason (if provided) and the roomnick or bare JID of the user who initiated the kick.</p>
    <example caption='Service Removes Kicked Occupant'><![CDATA[
<presence

    </item>
    <status code='307'/>
  </x>
</presence>
    ]]></example>
    <p>The inclusion of the status code assists clients in presenting their own notification messages (e.g., information appropriate to the user's locality). The optional inclusion of the reason and actor enable the kicked user to understand why he or she was kicked, and by whom if the kicked occupant would like to discuss the matter. <note>Some commentors have complained that this opens room owners and administrators up to potential abuse; unfortunately, with great power comes great responsibility.</note></p>
    <p>After removing the kicked occupant(s), the service MUST then inform the moderator of success:</p>
    <example caption='Service Informs Moderator of Success'><![CDATA[
<iq from='harfleur@chat.shakespeare.lit'
    id='kick1'
    to='fluellen@shakespeare.lit/pda'

    ]]></example>
    <p>After informing the moderator, the service MUST then inform all of the remaining occupants that the kicked occupant is no longer in the room by sending presence stanzas of type "unavailable" from the individual's roomnick (&OCCUPANTJID;) to all the remaining occupants (just as it does when occupants exit the room of their own volition), including the status code and optionally the reason and actor.</p>

    <status code='307'/>
  </x>
</presence>

[ ... ]
    ]]></example>
    <p>A user cannot be kicked by a moderator with a lower affiliation. Therefore, if a moderator who is a participant attempts to kick an admin or a moderator who is a participant or admin attempts to kick an owner, the service MUST deny the request and return a &notallowed; error to the sender:</p>
    <example caption='Service Returns Error on Attempt to Kick User With Higher Affiliation'><![CDATA[

  </error>
</iq>
    ]]></example>
    <p>If a moderator attempts to kick himself, the service MAY deny the request and return a &conflict; error to the sender. (Although the act of kicking oneself may seem odd, it is common in IRC as a way of apologizing for one's actions in the room.)</p>

<section1 topic='Admin Use Cases' anchor='admin'>
  <p>A room administrator has privileges to modify persistent information about user affiliations (e.g., by banning users) and to grant and revoke moderator status, but does not have rights to change the room configuration, which is the sole province of the room owner(s). Exactly which actions can be performed by a room admin is subject to configuration. However, for the purposes of the MUC framework, room admins are stipulated to at a minimum have privileges to perform the following actions:</p>
  <ol start='1'>
    <li>ban a user from the room</li>
    <li>modify the list of users who are banned from the room</li>
    <li>grant or revoke membership</li>
    <li>modify the member list</li>
    <li>grant or revoke moderator status</li>
    <li>modify the list of moderators</li>
  </ol>
  <p>These features are implemented with a request/response exchange using &lt;iq/&gt; elements that contain child elements qualified by the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#admin' namespace. The examples below illustrate the protocol interactions that implement the desired functionality. (Except where explicitly noted below, any of the following administrative requests MUST be denied if the &lt;user@host&gt; of the 'from' address of the request does not match the bare JID of one of the room admins; in this case, the service MUST return a &forbidden; error.)</p>
  <section2 topic='Banning a User' anchor='ban'>
    <p>An admin or owner can ban one or more users from a room. The ban MUST be performed based on the occupant's bare JID. In order to ban a user, an admin MUST change the user's affiliation to "outcast".</p>
    <example caption='Admin Bans User'><![CDATA[

      <reason>Treason</reason>
    </item>
  </query>
</iq>
    ]]></example>
    <p>The service MUST add that bare JID to the ban list, MUST remove the outcast's nickname from the list of registered nicknames, and MUST inform the admin or owner of success:</p>
    <example caption='Service Informs Admin or Owner of Success'><![CDATA[
<iq from='southampton@chat.shakespeare.lit'
    id='ban1'
    to='kinghenryv@shakespeare.lit/throne'
    type='result'/>
    ]]></example>
    <p>The service MUST also remove any banned users who are in the room by sending a presence stanza of type "unavailable" to each banned occupant, including status code 301 in the extended presence information, optionally along with the reason (if provided) and the roomnick or bare JID of the user who initiated the ban.</p>
    <example caption='Service Removes Banned User'><![CDATA[
<presence

      <reason>Treason</reason>
    </item>
    <status code='301'/>
  </x>
</presence>
    ]]></example>
    <p>The inclusion of the status code assists clients in presenting their own notification messages (e.g., information appropriate to the user's locality). The optional inclusion of the reason and actor enable the banned user to understand why he or she was banned, and by whom if the banned user would like to discuss the matter.</p>
    <p>The service MUST then inform all of the remaining occupants that the banned user is no longer in the room by sending presence stanzas of type "unavailable" from the banned user to all remaining occupants (just as it does when occupants exit the room of their own volition), including the status code and optionally the reason and actor:</p>
    <example caption='Service Informs Remaining Occupants'><![CDATA[
<presence
    type='unavailable'
    from='southampton@chat.shakespeare.lit/cambridge'

  </x>
</presence>

[ ... ]
    ]]></example>
    <p>As with <link url='#kick'>Kicking an Occupant</link>, a user cannot be banned by an admin with a lower affiliation. Therefore, if an admin attempts to ban an owner, the service MUST deny the request and return a &notallowed; error to the sender:</p>
    <example caption='Service Returns Error on Attempt to Ban User With Higher Affiliation'><![CDATA[

    <p>If an admin or owner attempts to ban himself, the service MUST deny the request and return a &conflict; error to the sender. (Note: This is different from the recommended service behavior on kicking oneself.)</p>

    <p>When an entity is banned from a room, an implementation SHOULD match JIDs in the following order (these matching rules are the same as those defined for privacy lists in &xep0016;):</p>
    <ol start='1'>
      <li>&lt;user@domain/resource&gt; (only that resource matches)</li>

      <li>&lt;domain&gt; (the domain itself matches, as does any user@domain or domain/resource)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Some administrators might wish to ban all users associated with a specific domain from all rooms hosted by a MUC service. Such functionality is a service-level feature and is therefore out of scope for this document; see <cite>XEP-0133</cite>.</p>

  <section2 topic='Modifying the Member List' anchor='modifymember'>
    <p>In the context of a members-only room, the member list is essentially a "whitelist" of people who are allowed to enter the room. Anyone who is not a member is effectively banned from entering the room, even if their affiliation is not "outcast".</p>
    <p>In the context of an open room, the member list is simply a list of users (bare JID and reserved nick) who are registered with the room. Such users can appear in a room roster, have their room nickname reserved, be returned in search results or FAQ queries, and the like.</p>
    <p>It is RECOMMENDED that only room admins have the privilege to modify the member list in members-only rooms. To do so, the admin first requests the member list by querying the room for all users with an affiliation of "member":</p>
    <example caption='Admin Requests Member List'><![CDATA[

  </query>
</iq>
    ]]></example>
    <p>Note: A service SHOULD also return the member list to any occupant in a members-only room; i.e., it SHOULD NOT generate a &forbidden; error when a member in the room requests the member list. This functionality can assist clients in showing all the existing members even if some of them are not in the room, e.g. to help a member determine if another user should be invited. A service SHOULD also allow any member to retrieve the member list even if not yet an occupant.</p>
    <p>The service MUST then return the full member list to the admin qualified by the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#admin' namespace; each item MUST include the 'affiliation' and 'jid' attributes and MAY include the 'nick' and 'role' attributes for each member that is currently an occupant.</p>

    <p>The admin MAY then modify the member list. In order to do so, the admin MUST send the changed items (i.e., only the "delta") to the service; each item MUST include the 'affiliation' attribute (normally set to a value of "member" or "none") and 'jid' attribute but SHOULD NOT include the 'nick' attribute (unless modifying the user's reserved nickname) and MUST NOT include the 'role' attribute (which is used to manage roles such as participant rather than affiliations such as member):</p>

<section1 topic='Owner Use Cases' anchor='owner'>
  <p>Every room MUST have at least one owner, and that owner (or a successor) is a long-lived attribute of the room for as long as the room exists (e.g., the owner does not lose ownership on exiting a persistent room). This document assumes that the (initial) room owner is the individual who creates the room and that only a room owner has the right to change defining room configuration settings such as the room type. Room owners can specify not only the room types (password-protected, members-only, etc.) but also certain attributes of the room as listed in the <link url='#reqs'>Requirements</link> section of this document. In addition, an owner can also specify the JIDs of other owners, if supported by the implementation.</p>
  <p>In order to provide the necessary flexibility for a wide range of configuration options, Data Forms (<cite>XEP-0004</cite>) are used for room configuration, triggered by use of the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc' namespace. If an entity does not include the MUC namespace in its room join/create request, then the service shall create the room and not wait for configuration via Data Forms before creating the room (this ensures backwards-compatibility with the old groupchat 1.0 protocol); however, if the room join/create request includes the MUC extension, then the service shall require configuration via Data Forms before creating and unlocking the room.</p>
  <p>Note: The configuration options shown below address all of the features and room types listed in the requirements section of this document; however, the exact configuration options and form layout shall be determined by the implementation or specific deployment. Also, these are examples only and are not intended to define the only allowed or required configuration options for rooms. A given implementation or deployment MAY choose to provide additional configuration options (clearance levels, profanity filters, supported languages, message logging, etc.), which is why the use of the 'jabber:x:data' protocol is valuable here.</p>
  <section2 topic='Creating a Room' anchor='createroom'>
    <section3 topic='General Considerations' anchor='createroom-general'>

      ]]></example>
      <p>If access is not restricted, the service MUST allow the user to create a room as described below.</p>
      <p>From the perspective of room creation, there are in essence two kinds of rooms:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>"Instant rooms" -- these are available for immediate access and are automatically created based on some default configuration.</p></li>
        <li><p>"Reserved rooms" -- these are manually configured by the room creator before anyone is allowed to enter.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The workflow for creating and configuring such rooms is as follows:</p>
      <ol start='1'>
        <li><p>The user sends presence to &OCCUPANTJID; and signal his or her support for the Multi-User Chat protocol by including extended presence information in an empty &lt;x/&gt; child element qualified by the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc' namespace (note the lack of an '#owner' or '#user' fragment).</p></li>
        <li><p>If this user is allowed to create a room and the room does not yet exist, the service MUST create the room according to some default configuration, assign the requesting user as the initial room owner, and add the owner to the room but not allow anyone else to enter the room (effectively "locking" the room). The initial presence stanza received by the owner from the room MUST include extended presence information indicating the user's status as an owner and acknowledging that the room has been created (via status code 201) and is awaiting configuration.</p></li>
        <li><p>If the initial room owner would like to create and configure a reserved room, the room owner MUST then request a configuration form by sending an IQ stanza of type "get" to the room containing an empty &lt;query/&gt; element qualified by the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#owner' namespace, then complete Steps 4 and 5. If the room owner would prefer to create an instant room, the room owner MUST send a query element qualified by the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#owner' namespace and containing an empty &lt;x/&gt; element of type "submit" qualified by the 'jabber:x:data' namespace, then skip to Step 6.</p></li>
        <li><p>If the room owner requested a configuration form, the service MUST send an IQ result to the room owner containing a configuration form qualified by the 'jabber:x:data' namespace. If there are no configuration options available, the room MUST return an empty query element to the room owner.</p></li>
        <li><p>The initial room owner SHOULD provide a starting configuration for the room (or accept the default configuration) by sending an IQ set containing the completed configuration form. Alternatively, the room owner MAY cancel the configuration process. (An implementation MAY set a timeout for initial configuration, such that if the room owner does not configure the room within the timeout period, the room owner is assumed to have accepted the default configuration or to have cancelled the configuration process.)</p></li>
        <li><p>Once the service receives the completed configuration form from the initial room owner (or receives a request for an instant room), the service MUST "unlock" the room (i.e., allow other users to enter the room) and send an IQ of type "result" to the room owner. If the service receives a cancellation, it MUST destroy the room.</p></li>
      </ol>
      <p>The protocol for this workflow is shown in the examples below.</p>
      <p>First, the user MUST send presence to the room, including an empty &lt;x/&gt; element qualified by the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc' namespace (this is the same stanza sent when seeking to enter a room).</p>
      <example caption='User Creates a Room and Signals Support for Multi-User Chat'><![CDATA[
<presence
    from='crone1@shakespeare.lit/desktop'
    to='coven@chat.shakespeare.lit/firstwitch'>
  <x xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/muc'/>
</presence>
      ]]></example>
      <p>If the room does not yet exist, the service SHOULD create the room (subject to local policies regarding room creation), assign the bare JID of the requesting user as the owner, add the owner to the room, and acknowledge successful creation of the room by sending a presence stanza of the following form:</p>
      <example caption="Service Acknowledges Room Creation"><![CDATA[
<presence
    from='coven@chat.shakespeare.lit/firstwitch'
    to='crone1@shakespeare.lit/desktop'>
  <x xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#user'>
    <item affiliation='owner'
          role='moderator'/>
    <status code='110'/>
    <status code='201'/>
  </x>
</presence>
      ]]></example>
      <p>After receiving notification that the room has been created, the room owner needs to decide whether to accept the default room configuration (i.e., create an "instant room") or configure the room to use something other than the default room configuration (i.e., create a "reserved room"). The protocol flows for completing those two use cases are shown in the following sections.</p>
      <p>Note: If the presence stanza sent to a nonexistent room does not include an &X; element qualified by the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc' namespace as shown above, the service SHOULD create a default room without delay (i.e., it MUST assume that the client supports groupchat 1.0 rather than MUC and therefore it MUST NOT lock the room while waiting for the room creator to either accept an instant room or configure a reserved room).</p>

  <section2 topic='Modifying the Admin List' anchor='modifyadmin'>
    <p>A room owner might want to modify the admin list. To do so, the owner first requests the admin list by querying the room for all users with an affiliation of 'admin'.</p>
    <example caption='Owner Requests Admin List'><![CDATA[
<iq from='bard@shakespeare.lit/desktop'
    id='admin3'

    type='get'>
  <query xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#admin'>
    <item affiliation='admin'/>
  </query>
</iq>
    ]]></example>
    <p>If the &lt;user@host&gt; of the 'from' address does not match the bare JID of a room owner, the service MUST return a &forbidden; error to the sender.</p>
    <p>Otherwise, the service MUST then return the admin list to the owner; each item MUST include the 'affiliation' and 'jid' attributes and MAY include the 'nick' and 'role' attributes for any admin that is currently an occupant:</p>
    <example caption='Service Sends Admin List to Owner'><![CDATA[
<iq from='coven@chat.shakespeare.lit'
    id='admin3'
    to='bard@shakespeare.lit/globe'

    <item affiliation='admin'
          jid='hag66@shakespeare.lit'/>
  </query>
</iq>
    ]]></example>
    <p>The owner MAY then modify the admin list. In order to do so, the owner MUST send the changed items (i.e., only the "delta") back to the service; <note>This is different from the behavior of room configuration, wherein the "muc#roomconfig_roomadmins" field specifies the full list of room admins, not the delta.</note> each item MUST include the 'affiliation' attribute (normally set to a value of "admin" or "none") and 'jid' attribute but SHOULD NOT include the 'nick' attribute and MUST NOT include the 'role' attribute (which is used to manage roles such as participant rather than affiliations such as owner).</p>
    <example caption='Owner Sends Modified Admin List to Service'><![CDATA[

  </query>
</iq>
    ]]></example>
    <p>Only owners shall be allowed to modify the admin list. If a non-owner attempts to view or modify the admin list, the service MUST deny the request and return a &forbidden; error to the sender.</p>
    <example caption='Service Returns Error on Attempt by Non-Owner to Modify Admin List'><![CDATA[

  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Destroying a Room' anchor='destroyroom'>
    <p>A room owner MUST be able to destroy a room, especially if the room is persistent. The workflow is as follows:</p>
    <ol start='1'>
      <li><p>The room owner requests that the room be destroyed, optionally specifying a reason and an alternate venue.</p></li>
      <li><p>The room removes all users from the room (including appropriate information about the alternate location and the reason for being removed) and destroys the room, even if it was defined as persistent.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Other than the foregoing, this document does not specify what (if anything) a MUC service implementation shall do as a result of a room destruction request. For example, if the room was defined as persistent, an implementation MAY choose to lock the room ID so that it cannot be re-used, redirect enter requests to the alternate venue, or invite the current participants to the new room; however, such behavior is OPTIONAL.</p>
    <p>In order to destroy a room, the room owner MUST send an IQ set to the address of the room to be destroyed. The &IQ; stanza shall contain a &QUERY; element qualified by the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#owner' namespace, which in turn shall contain a &lt;destroy/&gt; element. The address of the alternate venue MAY be provided as the value of the &lt;destroy/&gt; element's 'jid' attribute. A password for the alternate venue MAY be provided as the XML character data of a &lt;password/&gt; child element of the &lt;destroy/&gt; element. The reason for the room destruction MAY be provided as the XML character data of a &lt;reason/&gt; child element of the &lt;destroy/&gt; element.</p>
    <p>The following examples illustrate the protocol elements to be sent and received:</p>
    <example caption='Owner Submits Room Destruction Request'><![CDATA[
<iq from='crone1@shakespeare.lit/desktop'
    id='begone'
    to='heath@chat.shakespeare.lit'

  <query xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#owner'>
    <destroy jid='coven@chat.shakespeare.lit'>
      <reason>Macbeth doth come.</reason>
    </destroy>
  </query>
</iq>
    ]]></example>
    <p>The service is responsible for removing all the occupants. It SHOULD NOT broadcast presence stanzas of type "unavailable" from all occupants, instead sending only one presence stanza of type "unavailable" to each occupant so that the user knows he or she has been removed from the room. If extended presence information specifying the JID of an alternate location and the reason for the room destruction was provided by the room owner, the presence stanza MUST include that information.</p>

<section1 topic='Status Codes' anchor='statuscodes'>
  <p>Multi-User Chat uses a &lt;status/&gt; element (specifically, the 'code' attribute of the &lt;status/&gt; element) to communicate information about a user's status in a room. Over time, the number of status codes has grown quite large, and new status codes continue to be requested of the author. Therefore, these codes are now documented in a registry maintained by the XMPP Registrar. For details, refer to the <link url='#registrar-statuscodes'>Status Codes Registry</link> section of this document.</p>
  <p>Note: In general, MUC status codes tend to follow the "philosophy" of status codes that is implicit in &rfc2616; and &rfc1893; (1xx codes are informational, 2xx codes specify that it is fine to continue, 3xx codes specify redirects such as being kicked or banned, x3x codes refer to system status, x7x codes refer to security or policy matters, etc.).</p>
  <p>Note: If the MUC protocol were being designed today, it would specify a more flexible, XML-friendly approach rather than hardcoded status numbers; however, at this point the pain of changing the status reporting system would be greater than the benefit of doing so, which is why the status code numbers remain in use. A future version of this document may define a more XMPP-like approach to status conditions, retaining the code numbers but supplementing them with more descriptive child elements as is done in <cite>RFC 6120</cite>.</p>
</section1>

<section1 topic='Internationalization Considerations' anchor='i18n'>
  <p>As specified in <cite>RFC 6120</cite>, XMPP entities (including MUC rooms and MUC services) SHOULD respect the value of the 'xml:lang' attribute provided with any given stanza. However, simultaneous translation of groupchat messages is out of scope for this document (see &xep0171;).</p>
  <p>The status and error codes defined herein enable a client implementation to present a localized interface; however, definition of the localized text strings for any given language community is out of scope for this document.</p>
  <p>Although the labels for various data form fields are shown here in English, MUC clients SHOULD present localized text for these fields rather than the English text.</p>
  <p>Nicknames can contain virtually any Unicode character. This introduces the possibility of nick spoofing; see &rfc6122; for a description of related security considerations.</p>
</section1>

<section1 topic='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>
  <section2 topic='User Authentication and Authorization' anchor='security-auth'>
    <p>No room entrance authentication or authorization method more secure than cleartext passwords is defined or required by this document. Although the risks involved can mitigated somewhat by the use of channel encryption and strong authentication via TLS and SASL as described in <cite>RFC 6120</cite>, an entity that joins a room has no way of knowing if its complete communication channel to the room is encrypted (thereby protecting the plaintext password). A future specification might define an XMPP profile of SASL for use with MUC, but currently there is no such specification.</p>
  </section2>

  <section2 topic='End-to-End Encryption' anchor='security-e2e'>
    <p>No end-to-end message or session encryption method is specified herein. Users SHOULD NOT trust a service to keep secret any text sent through a room. A future specification might define a method for end-to-end encryption of MUC traffic, but currently there is no such specification.</p>
  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Privacy' anchor='security-privacy'>
    <p>Depending on room configuration, a room might publicly log all discussions held in the room. A service MUST warn the user that the room is publicly logged by returning a status code of "170" with the user's initial presence, and the user's client MUST warn the user if the room discussion is logged (a user's client SHOULD also query the room for its configuration prior to allowing the user to enter in order to "pre-discover" whether the room is logged). A client MUST also warn the user if the room's configuration is subsequently modified to allow room logging (which the client will discover when the room sends status code 170).</p>
    <p>Note: In-room history is different from public room logging, and naturally a room cannot effectively prevent occupants from separately maintaining their own room logs, which may become public; users SHOULD exercise due caution and consider any room discussions to be effectively public.</p>
  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Information Leaks' anchor='security-leaks'>
    <p>The "roominfo" data form used in extended service discovery can result in information leaks, e.g., the current discussion topic (via the "roominfo_subject" field). The same is true of service discovery items (disco#items) requests from outside the room (which could be used to discover the list of room occupants).</p>
    <p>Implementations and deployments are advised to carefully consider the possibility that this information might be leaked, and to turn off information sharing by default for sensitive data.</p> 
  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Anonymity' anchor='security-anon'>
    <p>Depending on room configuration, a room might expose each occupant's real JID to other occupants (if the room is non-anonymous). If real JIDs are exposed to all occupants in the room, the service MUST warn the user by returning a status code of "100" with the user's initial presence, and the user's client MUST warn the user (a user's client SHOULD also query the room for its configuration prior to allowing the user to enter in order to "pre-discover" whether real JIDs are exposed in the room). A client MUST also warn the user if the room's configuration is modified from semi-anonymous to non-anonymous (which the client will discover when the room sends status code 172).</p>
  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Denial of Service' anchor='security-dos'>
    <p>Public MUC rooms can be subject to a number of attacks, most of which reduce to denial of service attacks. Such attacks include but are not limited to:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Stuffing the room with a large number of illegitimate occupants and therefore preventing legitimate users from joining the room.</li>
      <li>Sending abusive messages and then leaving the room before a kick or ban can be applied; such abusive messages include but are not limited to large messages that prevent participants from following the conversation thread or room history, personal attacks on participants (especially room administrators and moderators), offensive text, and links to spam sites.</li>
      <li>Making rapid and repeated presence changes.</li>
      <li>Using long nicknames to route around lack of voice.</li>
      <li>Abusing the room administrators or other room occupants.</li>
      <li>Registering multiple nicknames across a service and therefore denying the use of those nicknames.</li>
      <li>Mimicking another occupant's roomnick (e.g., by adding a space at the end or substituting visually similar characters), then sending messages from that roomnick in an effort to confuse the occupants.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These attacks can be mitigated but not completely prevented through the liberal use of administrative actions such as banning, the presence of automated room bots with admin status, implementation of intelligent content filtering, checking the IP addresses of connected users (not always possible in a distributed system), applying voice rules to presence as well as messaging, matching room nicks using more stringent rules than the Resourceprep profile of stringprep, etc. However, experience has shown that it is impossible to fully prevent attacks of this kind.</p>
    <p>Public MUC services also can be subject to attacks, such as creating a large number of rooms on a service, leaving rooms in an unconfigured state, etc. Such service-level attacks can be mitigated by limiting the number of rooms that any given non-adminstrative user can own, deleting rooms if they remain in the unconfigured state for too long, etc.</p>

<section1 topic='Business Rules' anchor='bizrules'>
  <section2 topic='Addresses' anchor='bizrules-jids'>
    <p>In order to provide consistency regarding the addresses captured in room JIDs, Room IDs MUST match the Nodeprep profile of Stringprep and Room Nicknames MUST match the Resourceprep profile of Stringprep (both of these are defined in <cite>RFC 6122</cite>). As explicitly stated in <cite>RFC 6122</cite>, both the Room ID (node) and Room Nickname (resource) portions of an Occupant JID MUST be of non-zero length. In addition, a MUC service MUST NOT allow empty or invisible Room Nicknames (i.e., Room Nicknames that consist only of one or more space characters).</p>
    <p>It is up to the service implementation whether it will further restrict roomnicks (e.g., by applying case folding routines, the Nodeprep profile of stringprep, or other restrictions).</p>
  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Message' anchor='bizrules-message'>
    <ol start='1'>
      <li><p>If an occupant wants to send a message to all other occupants, a MUC client MUST set the 'type' attribute to a value of "groupchat". A service MAY ignore messages that are improperly typed, or reject them with a &badrequest; error.</p></li>
      <li><p>If a MUC service receives a message directed to the room or to a single occupant from a user who has a role of "none", the service MUST NOT deliver the message and SHOULD return the message to the sender with a &forbidden; error.</p></li>
      <li><p>If a MUC service receives a message directed to a room that does not exist or is not yet unlocked, the service SHOULD return the message to the sender with an &notfound; error.</p></li>
      <li><p>A MUC service SHOULD pass extended information (e.g., an XHTML version of the message body) through to occupants unchanged; however, a MUC service MAY disallow message specific extensions (see the <link url='#impl-service-traffic'>Allowable Traffic</link> section of this document).</p></li>
      <li><p>A MUC client MAY generate extensions that conform to &xep0085; specification; however, a MUC service MAY disallow these extensions (see the <link url='#impl-service-traffic'>Allowable Traffic</link> section of this document).</p></li>
    </ol>
  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Presence' anchor='bizrules-presence'>
    <ol start='1'>
      <li><p>The presence stanza used to join a room MUST NOT possess a 'type' attribute, i.e., it must be available presence. A MUC service MUST NOT treat a presence stanza with a 'type' attribute (e.g., a presence probe) as a request to join the room.</p></li>
      <li><p>The presence stanza used to exit a room MUST possess a 'type' attribute whose value is "unavailable". A MUC service MUST NOT treat a presence stanza with a 'type' attribute whose value is other than "unavailable" (e.g., a presence probe) as a request to exit the room.</p></li>
      <li><p>A MUC service MAY handle presence probes sent to the room JID &ROOMJID; or an occupant JID &OCCUPANTJID; (e.g, these might be sent by an occupant's home server to determine if the room is still online or to synchronize presence information if the user or the user's server has gone offline temporarily or has started sharing presence again, as for instance when &xep0273; is used).</p></li>
      <li><p>A room MUST silently ignore unavailable presence received from a user who has a role of "none".</p></li>
      <li><p>Only the MUC service itself SHOULD generate data about roles, affiliations, full JIDs, or status codes qualified by the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#user' namespace (based on information the service knows about occupants, e.g., roles, or as a result of actions taken by a moderator or room administrator). A client SHOULD NOT presume to generate such information. If a MUC service receives such extended presence information from an occupant, it MUST NOT reflect it to other occupants. (A client MAY generate extended presence information qualified by the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#user' namespace in order to supply a password, but naturally this is not reflected to other occupants.)</p></li>
      <li><p>A MUC service SHOULD allow all other presence information to pass through, although it MAY choose to block extended presence information; see the <link url='#impl-service-traffic'>Allowable Traffic</link> section of this document.</p></li>
      <li><p>In order to inform occupants of room roles and affiliations, and to make it easier for clients to track the current state of all users in the room, MUC service implementations MUST provide role and affiliation data (and, if allowed by the room configuration, full JID) in all presence stanzas, including presence stanzas of type "unavailable" sent when a user exits the room for any reason.</p></li>
      <li><p>If a role or affiliation is revoked, the service MUST note that fact by sending an &lt;x/&gt; element qualified by the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#user' namespace and containing an &lt;item/&gt; child element with the 'role' and/or 'affiliation' attributes set to a value that indicates the loss of the relevant status. All future presence stanzas for the occupant MUST include the updated role and affiliation, until and unless they change again.</p></li>
      <li><p>A MUC service MUST include the MUC extensions even if the client did not send an empty &lt;x/&gt; element qualified by the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc' namespace on entering the room; naturally, a client MUST ignore such information if it does not understand it (in accordance with <cite>RFC 6120</cite>).</p></li>
      <li><p>If the service includes an occupant's JabberID in the MUC presence extension, the value of the 'jid' attribute MUST be the full JID (not the bare JID).</p></li>
      <li><p>A client MAY send a custom exit message if desired (as is often done in IRC channels) by including a &lt;status/&gt; element in the presence stanza of type "unavailable" sent when <link url='#exit'>exiting a room</link>.</p></li>

  </section2>

  <section2 topic='IQ' anchor='bizrules-iq'>
    <ol start='1'>
      <li><p>MUC is designed for sharing of messages and presence, not IQs. An IQ sent to the JID of the room itself is handled by the room and is not reflected to all of the room occupants.</p></li>
      <li><p>If an occupant wants to send an IQ stanza to another user in a non-anonymous room, the sender SHOULD send the request directly to the recipient's bare JID or full JID, rather than attempting to send the request through the room (i.e., via the recipient's room JID).</p></li>
      <li><p>If an occupant wants to send an IQ stanza to another user in a semi-anonymous room, the sender can direct the stanza to the recipient's room JID and the service SHOULD forward the stanza to the recipient's real JID. However, the MUC service MUST NOT reveal the sender's real JID to the recipient at any time, nor reveal the recipient's real JID to the sender.</p></li>
      <li><p>A MUC client MUST send only the 'affiliation' attribute or the 'role' attribute in the &lt;item/&gt; element contained within an IQ set qualified by the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#admin' namespace; if a moderator, admin, or owner attempts to modify both the affiliation and role of the same item in the same IQ set, the service MUST return a &badrequest; error to the sender. However, the MUC service MAY modify a role based on a change to an affiliation and thus MAY send presence updates that include both a modified role and a modified affiliation.</p></li>
      <li><p>In IQ sets regarding roles, a MUC client MUST include the 'nick' attribute only; in IQ results regarding roles, a MUC service MUST include the 'nick', 'role', 'affiliation', and 'jid' attributes (with the value of the latter set to the user's full JID).</p></li>
      <li><p>In IQ sets regarding affiliations, a MUC client MUST include the 'jid' attribute only (with the value set to the bare JID); in IQ results regarding affiliations, a MUC service MUST NOT include the 'role' attribute, MUST include the 'affiliation' attribute and the 'jid' attribute (with the value set to the bare JID), and SHOULD include the 'nick' attribute (except if the affiliation is "outcast", since outcasts SHOULD NOT have reserved nicknames).</p></li>

<section1 topic='Implementation Notes' anchor='impl'>
  <p>The following guidelines are intended to assist client and component developers in creating MUC implementations.</p>
  <section2 topic='Services' anchor='impl-service'>
    <ol start='1'>
      <li><p>In handling messages sent by visitors in a moderated room, a MUC service MAY queue each message for approval by a moderator and MAY inform the sender that the message is being held for approval; however, such behavior is OPTIONAL, and definition of a message approval protocol (e.g., using Data Forms as defined in <cite>XEP-0004</cite>) is out of scope for this document.</p></li>
      <li><p>Out of courtesy, a MUC service MAY send an out-of-room &lt;message/&gt; if a user's affiliation changes while the user is not in the room; the message SHOULD be sent from the room to the user's bare JID, MAY contain a &lt;body/&gt; element describing the affiliation change, and MUST contain a status code of 101.</p></li>
      <li><p>There is no requirement that a MUC service shall provide special treatment for users of the older groupchat 1.0 protocol, such as messages that contain equivalents to the extended presence information that is qualified by the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#user' namespace.</p></li>
      <li><p>Room types MAY be configured in any combination. A MUC service MAY support or allow any desired room types or combinations thereof. There is no guarantee that any such combination is sensible.</p></li>
      <li><p>A MUC service MAY limit the number of configuration options presented to an owner after initial configuration has been completed, e.g. because certain options cannot take effect without restarting the service.</p></li>
      <li><p>A MUC service MAY provide an interface to room creation and configuration (e.g., in the form of a special XMPP entity or a Web page), so that the ostensible room owner is actually the application instead of a human user.</p></li>
      <li><p>A MUC service MAY choose to make available a special in-room resource that provides an interface to administrative functionality (e.g., a "user" named "ChatBot"), which occupants could interact with directly, thus enabling admins to type <tt>'/command parameter'</tt> in a private message to that "user". Obviously this kind of implementation would require the service to add a 'ChatBot' user to the room when it is created, and to prevent any occupant from having the nickname 'ChatBot' in the room. This might be difficult to ensure in some implementations or deployments. In any case, any such interface is OPTIONAL.</p></li>
      <li><p>A MUC service MAY choose to discard extended presence information that is attached to a &PRESENCE; stanza before reflecting the presence change to the occupants of a room. That is, an implementation MAY choose to reflect only the &lt;show/&gt;, &lt;status/&gt;, and &lt;priority/&gt; child elements of the presence element as specified in the XML schema for the 'jabber:client' namespace, with the result that presence "changes" in extended namespaces (e.g., gabber:x:music:info) are not passed through to occupants. If a service prohibits certain extended namespaces, it SHOULD provide a description of allowable traffic at the well-known Service Discovery node 'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#traffic' as described in the <link url='#impl-service-traffic'>Allowable Traffic</link> section of this document.</p></li>
      <li><p>A MUC service MAY choose to discard extended information attached to a &MESSAGE; stanza before reflecting the message to the occupants of a room. An example of such extended information is the lightweight text markup specified by &xep0071;. If a service prohibits certain extended namespaces, it SHOULD provide a description of allowable traffic at the well-known Service Discovery node 'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#traffic' as described in the <link url='#impl-service-traffic'>Allowable Traffic</link> section of this document.</p></li>
      <li><p>A MUC service MAY choose to "lock down" room nicknames (e.g., hardcoding the room nickname to the bare JID of the occupant). If so, the service MUST treat the locked nickname as a reserved room nickname and MUST support the protocol specified in the <link url='#reservednick'>Discovering Reserved Room Nickname</link> section of this document.</p></li> 
    </ol>

    <section3 topic='Allowable Traffic' anchor='impl-service-traffic'>
      <p>As noted, a service (more precisely, a properly-configured room) MAY discard some or all extended namespaces attached to &MESSAGE; and &PRESENCE; stanzas that are intended for reflection from the sender through the room to all of the room occupants. If the room does so, it SHOULD enable senders to discover the list of allowable extensions by sending a disco#info query to the well-known Service Discovery node 'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#traffic', returning one &lt;feature/&gt; element for each namespace supported in the result. If the room does not allow any extended namespaces, it MUST return an empty query as specified in <cite>XEP-0030</cite>. If the room does not support the "#traffic" node, it MUST return a &feature; error in response to queries sent to the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#traffic' node.</p>
      <p>The following example shows a room that allows the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/xhtml-im' and 'http://jabber.org/protocol/rosterx' namespaces only, but no other extended namespaces.</p>

    <section3 topic='Ghost Users' anchor='impl-service-ghosts'>
      <p>Deployment experience has shown that sometimes a user can appear to be an occupant in a room even though the user's real JID has gone offline since joining. Such users are called "ghosts". To help prevent ghost users, a MUC service SHOULD remove a user if the service receives a delivery-related error in relation to a stanza it has previously sent to the user (in this context, the delivery-related errors are &gone;, &notfound;, &recipient;, &redirect;, &remoteserver;, and &timeout;). A MUC service MAY also use &xep0199; or similar methods to periodically check the availability of room occupants. If the MUC service determines that the user has gone offline, it must treat the user as if the user had itself sent unavailable presence.</p>

      <li><p>Clients MAY present room roles by showing ad-hoc groups for each role within a room roster. This will enable occupants to clearly visualize which occupants are moderators, participants, and visitors. However, such a representation is OPTIONAL.</p></li>
      <li><p>Clients MAY implement a variety of interface styles that provide "shortcuts" to functionality such as changing one's nickname, kicking or banning users, discovering an occupant's full JID, or changing the subject. One option consists of IRC-style commands such as '/nick', '/kick', '/ban', and '/whois'; another is to enable a user to right-click items in a room roster. All such interface styles are OPTIONAL. However, for convenience, a mapping of IRC commands to MUC protocols is provided below.</p></li>

      <p>Note: Because MUC roomnicks follow the Resourceprep profile of stringprep, they are allowed to contain a space character, whereas IRC nicknames do not. Although a given client MAY support quotation characters for this purpose (resulting in commands such as '/ban "king lear" insanity is no defense'), most common quotation characters (such as " and ') are also allowed by Resourceprep, thus leading to added complexity and potential problems with quotation of roomnicks that contain both spaces and quotation characters. Therefore it is NOT RECOMMENDED for XMPP clients to support IRC-style shortcut commands with roomnicks that contain space characters.</p>
      <p>Note: Many XMPP clients also implement a '/me ' command as described in &xep0245;. This command does not result in any MUC or IRC protocol action and is therefore not shown in the foregoing table.</p>

    <section3 topic='Presence Subscriptions' anchor='impl-client-presence'>
      <p>In XMPP, presence subscriptions are used to share network availability information between end users (see &rfc6121;). In XMPP groupchat, the presence employed is of a special type: directed presence rather than presence subscriptions. However, an IM user can also subscribe to the presence of a chatroom, which introduces the useful property that the user will be notified when a room comes back online after a crash or other outage, thus facilitating the feature of automatically re-joining the room. Although MUC clients and servers have not traditionally implemented presence subscriptions, developers are encouraged to consider adding such support.</p>
