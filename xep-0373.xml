<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>

  <p>This XMPP extension protocol specifies the foundations of
  end-to-end encryption and authentication, based on digital
  signatures, of data with the help of OpenPGP. Additional XEPs will
  use this extension protocol as building block when specifying their
  own OpenPGP profile suiting their use case. One such profile is the
  Instant Messaging Profile specified in &xep0374;.</p>

  <p>XMPP provides the mechanisms to solve a lot of issues that come
  with modern day OpenPGP usage. For example, based on &xep0163; this
  specification describes a standardized way to discover OpenPGP
  public keys of other entities. But unlike the OpenPGP keyservers,
  this process establishes a strong relation between the key and the
  key's owning entity (usually a human user). A similar mechanism
  described herein allows to synchronize the secret key(s) across
  multiple devices.</p>

  <p>OpenPGP in return allows for end-to-end encrypted data to be
  exchanged between one, two or even multiple entities
  (multi-end-to-multi-end encryption). Therefore this XEP can be used
  for example to implement end-to-end encrypted &xep0045;.</p>

    <p>The &openpgp; extension element qualified by the
    'urn:xmpp:openpgp:0' namespace is used in order to exchange
    encrypted and signed data.</p>

    <example caption='The &openpgp; extension within a message.'><![CDATA[
<message to='juliet@example.org'>
  <openpgp xmlns='urn:xmpp:openpgp:0'>
    BASE64_OPENPGP_MESSAGE
  </openpgp>
</message>]]></example>

    <p>The text content of &openpgp; ("BASE64_OPENPGP_MESSAGE") is a
    Base64 encoded (&rfc4648; <link
    url='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-4'>§ 4</link>)
    OpenPGP message as specified in &rfc4880; which contains an
    encrypted and/or signed UTF-8 (&rfc3629;) encoded string. This
    string MUST correspond to exactly one OpenPGP content element,
    that is, it represents either a &signcrypt;, a &sign; or a &crypt;
    extension element qualified by the 'urn:xmpp:openpgp:0'
    namespace. Note that OpenPGP's ASCII Armor is not used, instead
    the XMPP client MUST encode the raw bytes of OpenPGP message using
    Base64.</p>

    <p>In case of a &signcrypt; element, the OpenPGP message embedded
    in the &openpgp; element MUST be encrypted and signed, and SHOULD
    also be encrypted to self. In case of a &sign; element, the
    OpenPGP message MUST be signed and MUST NOT be encrypted. In case
    of &crypt; the OpenPGP message MUST NOT be signed, but MUST be
    encrypted.</p>

    <example caption='The &signcrypt; extension element.'><![CDATA[
<signcrypt xmlns='urn:xmpp:openpgp:0'>

  <payload>
    <body xmlns='jabber:client'>
      This is a secret message.
    </body>
  </payload>
</signcrypt>]]></example>

    <p>OpenPGP content elements MUST possess exactly one 'time'
    element as direct child elements. The &signcrypt; and &crypt;
    content elements MUST contain at least one 'to' element(s), which
    MUST have a 'jid' attribute containing the intended recipient's
    XMPP address of the signed and/or encrypted data to prevent
    Surreptitious Forward Attacks<note>Jee Hea An, Yevgeniy Dodis, and
    Tal Rabin. 2002. On the Security of Joint Signature and
    Encryption. In Proceedings of the International Conference on the
    Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques: Advances in
    Cryptology (EUROCRYPT '02), Lars R. Knudsen

    The XMPP address found in the 'to' element's 'jid' attribute
    SHOULD be without Resourcepart (i.e., a bare JID). A &sign; content
    element may not carry a 'to' attribute. The 'time' element MUST
    have a 'stamp' attribute which contains the timestamp when the
    OpenPGP content element was signed and/or encrypted in the
    DateTime format as specified in &xep0082; § 3.2. The &signcrypt;
    and &crypt; elements SHOULD furthermore contain a 'rpad' element
    which text content is a random-length random-content padding.</p>

    <table caption='OpenPGP Content Element Properties'>
      <tr>
        <th>Content Element</th>
        <th>'to' Element</th>
        <th>'time' Element</th>
        <th>&lt;rpad/&gt; Element</th>
        <th>&lt;payload/&gt; Element</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&signcrypt;</td>
        <td>MUST have at least one</td>
        <td>MUST have exactly one</td>
        <td>SHOULD have exaclty one</td>
        <td>MUST have exactly one</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&sign;</td>
        <td>MAY NOT contain one</td>
        <td>MUST have exaclty one</td>
        <td>NOT REQUIRED</td>
        <td>MUST have exactly one</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>

        <td>SHOULD have exaclty one</td>
        <td>MUST have exactly one</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>OpenPGP content elements MUST possess exactly one &payload;
    element. The child elements of &payload; can be seen as OpenPGP
    secured Stanza extension elements which are encrypted and/or
    signed. After the &openpgp; element and the including &signcrypt;,
    &sign; or &crypt; element was verified, they are processed
    according to the specification of the relevant OpenPGP for XMPP
    profile (see for example &xep0374;).</p>

  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Verification of &openpgp; Content' anchor='openpgp-verification'>

    <p>Recipients MUST verify that the signature is valid, that the
    signature's key corresponds to the sender's key, and that the
    sender's key has a User ID containing the sender's XMPP
    address in the form "xmpp:juliet@example.org" (for details see
    <link url='#openpgp-user-ids'>"OpenPGP User IDs"</link>). Thus,
    the recipient may
    need to retrieve the key from the Personal Eventing Protocol node
    as described above. At least one of the XMPP addresses found in
    the 'to' elements contained in OpenPGP content element MUST
    correspond to the outer 'to' of the XMPP &MESSAGE;. Furthermore,
    recipients are RECOMMENDED to verify the 'time' element for
    plausibility or to display it to a user for verification.</p>

  </section2>

</section1>

<section1 topic='Announcing and Discovering the Public Key via PEP' anchor='announcing-discover-pubkey'>

  <p>Parties interested in exchanging encrypted data between each
  other via OpenPGP need to know the public key(s) of the
  recipients. The following section specifies a mechanism to announce
  and discover public keys.</p>

  <section2 topic='Announcing the Public Key via PEP' anchor='annoucning-pubkey'>

    <p>In order to announce the public key, the client needs to store
    it in a PEP node. The public key data, as specified in <cite>RFC
    4880</cite>, is stored within a &lt;pubkey/&gt; element which is a
    child element of the &lt;pubkeys/&gt; element qualified by the
    'urn:xmpp:openpgp:0' namespace. Note that OpenPGP's ASCII Armor is
    not used, instead the XMPP client MUST encode the public key using
    Base64. Client SHOULD only try to store the public key if the
    Personal Eventing Protocol service supports persistent-items, thus
    it SHOULD check if the service reports the
    'http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub#persistent-items' feature.</p>

    <example caption='Saving the public key in the PEP node.'><![CDATA[

      </publish>
    </pubsub>
</iq>]]></example>

  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Discovering the Public Key via PEP' anchor='discover-pubkey'>

    <p>In order to discover the public key of an XMPP entity, clients
    send a PubSub &IQ; request to the entity's bare JID of which it
    wants to know the public key.</p>

    <example caption='Requesting a OpenPGP public key from an XMPP entity.'><![CDATA[
<iq from='romeo@example.org/orchard'
    to='juliet@example.org'
    type='get'
    id='getpub'>
  <pubsub xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub'>
    <items node='urn:xmpp:openpgp:0'
           max_items='1'/>
  </pubsub>
</iq>]]></example>
    <example caption='Personal Eventing Protocol result containing the requested public key.'><![CDATA[

          </pubkey>
        </pubkeys>
      </item>
    </items>
  </pubsub>
  </iq>]]></example>

    <p>Note that the result may contain multiple pubkey elements. Only
    the public keys found in the most recent MUST be used. Requesters
    may want to limit the results to the most recent item using the
    'max_items' attribute set to '1'. Clients could alternatively use
    &xep0059; as an alternative to 'max_items' but accoding to
    <cite>XEP-0060</cite> RSM is not (yet) mandatory for PubSub
    services.</p>

    <p>Some XMPP services may not provide the Personal Eventing
    Protocol feature required to provide the mechanism described
    here. If so, they will return an &IQ; error of type
    service-unavailable.</p>

  </section2>

<section1 topic='Synchronizing the Secret Key with a Private PEP Node' anchor='synchro-pep'>

    <p>A private PEP node is used to allow XMPP clients to synchronize
    the user's secret OpenPGP key. Where private PEP node is defined: A
    PEP node in whitelist mode where only the bare JID of the key
    owner is whitelisted as described in &xep0223;. The secret key is
    additionally encrypted.</p>

    <section2 topic='Required PEP features'>

      <p>The used PEP server MUST support PEP and the whitelist access
      model. It SHOULD also support persistent items.</p>

        <p>The service discovery result must contain a PEP identity
        '&lt;identity category='pubsub' type='pep'/&gt;, and the

        <li>The whole backup code including the dashes is directly
        used as a string to encrypt the concatenated transferable keys

        url='http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-5.3'>§

    <p>OpenPGP implementations have a sad history of being not very

      <li>Opportunistic encryption</li>
      <li>Trust upon first contact</li>

    effective security by following the design principles and
    techniques for security mentioned in "Why Johnny Can't
    Encrypt".</p>

  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Stanza Size' anchor='stanza-size'>

    <p>Implementors should be aware that the size OpenPGP public and
    secret keys is somewhere in the range of tens of
    kilobytes. Applying Base64 encoding on keys, as it is described
    herein, further increases the size. The formula to determine the
    Base64 encoded size is: ceil(bytes / 3) * 4. Thus the lower bound
    for the maximum stanza size of 10000 bytes, as specified in <cite>RFC
    6120</cite> § 13.12. 4., is usually exceeded. However all XMPP server
    implementations, the authors are aware of, follow the
    recommendation of the RFC and do not blindly set the maximum
    stanza size to such a low value, but use a much higher
    threshold. Therefore, this should hardly be an issue for
    implementations. Nevertheless, it is advised to keep the size of
    OpenPGP keys small by removing all signatures except the most
    recent self-signature on each User ID before exporting the key
    (cf. GnuPG's <tt>--export-options export-minimal</tt>).
    In addition, implementors are advised to handle
    &lt;policy-violation/&gt; error responses when trying to
    transmit Base64 encoded keys.</p>

    <p>The format of XMPP addresses, sometimes called JIDs, is well
    defined. Thus they need to be normalized, as defined in
    &rfc7622;. When implementations are required to compare XMPP
    addresses for equality, as it is the case in <link
    url='#openpgp-verification'>"Verification of &openpgp;
    Content"</link>, then they also have to compare the normalized
    versions of the addresses.</p>

  <section2 topic='Key Handling' anchor='key-handling'>

    <p>This specification intentionally does not specify if the used
    OpenPGP key should be a primary key or a subkey. It is even
    possible to announce multiple public keys in the Personal Eventing
    Protocol node. Implementations MUST be prepared to find multiple
    public keys. The authors however believe that for ease of use only
    one OpenPGP key specially crafted for the XMPP use case should be
    created, announced and used.</p>

  </section2>

  <section2 topic='OpenPGP Element and Content Element Design' anchor='openpgp-element-design'>

    <p>The &openpgp; and OpenPGP content elements are container
    elements for arbitrary signed and encrypted data and can thus act
    as building blocks for encrypted data included in Message, IQ and
    Presence stanzas. For example, future specifications may use them
    to implement encrypted versions of &xep0047; or &xep0261;.</p>

    <p>Note that signed OpenPGP messages already contain a timestamp
    as per the OpenPGP specification. OpenPGP content elements
    nevertheless require the 'time' element because not every OpenPGP
    API may provide access to the embedded OpenPGP timestamp.</p>

    <p>The 'rpad' element of the OpenPGP content elements exists to
    prevent length-based side channel attacks.</p>

    5</link>). It mitigates replay attacks by including the
    recipient's address and a timestamp in the OpenPGP content
    element<note>Full Replay attack prevention would require a
    counter based approach.</note>. It allows for both, signing and
    encrypting of the element. The scope of the specification was
    deliberately limited to OpenPGP.</p>

  <section2 topic='Not using OpenPGP ASCII Armor' anchor='openpgp-ascii-armor'>

    <p>We decided against OpenPGP ASCII Armor (which contains an
    additional checksum) and in favor for Base64, because
    encoding should be part of the network application rather than the
    crypto layer. Also XMPP, needs no additional error correction of payload.
    In "MIME Security with OpenPGP" (<link
    url='http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3156'>&rfc3156;</link>), ASCII Armor
    has only been chosen to be backwards compatible with legacy applications
    supporting non-MIME OpenPGP emails only.</p>

  </section2>

  <section2 topic='OpenPGP User IDs' anchor='openpgp-user-ids'>

    <p>OpenPGP User IDs normally consist of a name - email address pair, e.g.,
    "Juliet &lt;juliet@example.org&gt;" (<link
    url='http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-5.11'><cite>RFC 4880 § 5.11</cite></link>).
    For this XEP, we require User IDs of the format "xmpp:juliet@example.org".
    First, it is required to have at least one User ID indicating the use
    of this OpenPGP key. When doing certification of keys (key signing),
    the partner must know what User ID she actually certifies.
    Second, this format uses the standardized URI from <cite>XEP-0147</cite> to indicate
    that this User ID corresponds to a key that is used for XMPP.
    Third, having the Real Name inside provides no additional security
    or guideline if this key should be certified. The XMPP address
    is the only trust anchor here.</p>

<section1 topic='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>

  <p>The scope of this XEP is intentionally limited, so that the
  specification just defines way for XMPP entities to discover,
  announce and synchronize OpenPGP keys, and how to exchange signed
  and encrypted data between two or more parties. Everything else is
  outside its scope. For example, how 'secure' the key material is
  protected on the endpoints is up to the implementation.</p>

  <p>And while this XEP specifies a mechanism how to discover and
  retrieve a public key, it does not define how the trust relation to
  this key should be established. Even if key discovery and retrieval
  over XMPP provides a stronger coupling between the possessing entity
  (the XMPP address) and the key, as compared to the OpenPGP keyservers,
  how a XMPP server authenticates a remote server is a server policy,
  which does vary from server to server. Implementation MUST provide a
  way for the user to establish and assign trust to a public key. For
  example by using a QR code shown on the recipient's device screen.</p>

  <p>Besides the protocol defined herein, OpenPGP implementations are
  another big attack surface. Needless to say that the security of
  encrypted data exchanged using this protocol depends on the security
  of the used OpenPGP implementation. It is strongly RECOMMENED to use
  existing implementations instead of writing your own. OpenPGP
  implementations have suffered from various vulnerabilities in the past
  which opened up DoS attack vectors. For example <link
  url='https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4402'>CVE-2013-4402</link>
  and <link
