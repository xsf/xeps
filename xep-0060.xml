<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <section2 topic='Overview' anchor='intro-overview'>
    <p>As Jabber/XMPP technologies have matured, the need for a generic publish-subscribe ("pubsub") mechanism has arisen in a number of domains. These include (but are not limited to): news feeds and content syndication, extended presence, avatar management, shared bookmarks, auction and trading systems, online catalogs, workflow systems, network management systems, NNTP gateways, profile management, and event notification.</p>
    <p>In all of these domains, it is desirable for data communication to follow the classic "publish-subscribe" or "observer" design pattern: a person or application publishes information, and an event notification (without or without payload) is broadcasted to all authorized subscribers. In general, the relationship between the publisher and subscriber is mediated by a service that receives publication requests, broadcasts event notifications to subscribers, and enables privileged entities to manage lists of people or applications that are authorized to publish or subscribe. In most pubsub services, the focal point for publication and subscription is a "topic" or "node" to which publishers send data and from which subscribers receive notifications. Additionally, some nodes may also maintain a history of events and provide other services that supplement the pure pubsub model.</p>
    <p>This document defines a single, cohesive, generic protocol that all forms of pubsub can use. While compliant implementations are not required to implement all of the features defined herein, this document addresses most use cases that may be requested of a pubsub service. (For information about which features are required and which are recommended or optional, consult the <link url='#features'>Feature Summary</link>.) Other specifications may define "subsets" or "profiles" of publish-subscribe for use in specialized contexts (e.g., &xep0163;), but such profiles are out of scope for this document.</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='How It Works' anchor='intro-howitworks'>
    <p>This specification is large. However, the basic idea behind pubsub is rather simple (see <link url='#publisher-publish'>Publish an Item to a Node</link>):</p>
    <ol>
      <li>An entity publishes information to a node at a publish-subscribe service.</li>
      <li>The pubsub service pushes a notification to all entities that are authorized to learn about the published information.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Perhaps the most popular application of pubsub-like functionality is content syndication, which has become familiar from the RSS and Atom (&rfc4287;) feeds associated with weblogs, news sites, and other frequently-updated information available on the Internet. Consider the example of a weblog published by &lt;hamlet@denmark.lit&gt;. When Hamlet writes a new weblog entry, his blogging software publishes the entry to a pubsub node hosted at &lt;pubsub.shakespeare.lit&gt;:</p>
    <example caption='Publisher Publishes a New Weblog Entry'><![CDATA[
<iq type='set'
    from='hamlet@denmark.lit/blogbot'
    to='pubsub.shakespeare.lit'
    id='pub1'>
  <pubsub xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub'>
    <publish node='princely_musings'>
      <item>
        <entry xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom'>
          <title>Soliloquy</title>
          <summary>
To be, or not to be: that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them?
          </summary>
          <link rel='alternate' type='text/html'
                href='http://denmark.lit/2003/12/13/atom03'/>
          <id>tag:denmark.lit,2003:entry-32397</id>
          <published>2003-12-13T18:30:02Z</published>
          <updated>2003-12-13T18:30:02Z</updated>
        </entry>
      </item>
    </publish>
  </pubsub>
</iq>
    ]]></example>
    <p>So that is the "pub" part of publish-subscribe.</p>
    <p>Now the pubsub service notifies all the subscribers about the new blog entry:</p>
    <example caption='Service Notifies Subscribers'><![CDATA[
<message from='pubsub.shakespeare.lit' to='francisco@denmark.lit' id='foo'>
  <event xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub#event'>
    <items node='princely_musings'>
      <item id='ae890ac52d0df67ed7cfdf51b644e901'>
        [ ... ENTRY ... ]

    </items>
  </event>

        [ ... ENTRY ... ]
      </item>
    </items>
  </event>
</message>
    ]]></example>
    <p>Here is an even simpler example: a transient node that sends only notifications without a payload:</p>
    <example caption='A Transient Notification'><![CDATA[
<message from='pubsub.shakespeare.lit' to='francisco@denmark.lit'>
  <event xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub#event'>
    <items node='elsinore/doorbell'/>
  </event>
</message>
    ]]></example>
    <p>Naturally, the entities involved may need to complete other use cases in order to enable full pubsub functionality -- for example, the publisher may need to create the node (see <link url='#owner-create'>Create a Node</link>) and subscribers may need to sign up for notifications (see <link url='#subscriber-subscribe'>Subscribe to a Node</link>). These use cases are fully described in the remainder of this document. (For information about which features are required and which are recommended or optional, consult the <link url='#features'>Feature Summary</link>.)</p>

<section1 topic='Requirements' anchor='reqs'>
  <p>Requirements for a pubsub service can be driven by end-user needs as well as the needs of other components and services which can use the service. First, a pubsub service implemented using Jabber MUST provide the basic features that implement a pure publish-subscribe pattern:</p>
        <!-- ================== MUSTS =================== -->
  <ul>
    <li>An entity MUST be able to publish events to a service such that all subscribers to a node receive notification of the event. See <link url='#publisher-publish'>Publish an Item to a Node</link>.</li>
    <li>An entity MUST be able to subscribe to a node (or be informed that subscription is not allowed). See <link url='#subscriber-subscribe'>Subscribe to a Node</link>.</li>
    <li>An entity MUST be allowed to be affiliated with a node. Allowable affiliations are owner, publisher, none, and outcast. Implementations MUST support affiliations of owner and none, and MAY support affiliations of outcast and publisher. See <link url='#affiliations'>Affiliations</link>.</li>
    <li>An entity MUST be allowed to query the pubsub service (or a specific node) to determine what optional features of this specification the service (or node) implements. This query MUST use the Service Discovery (disco#info) protocol. See <link url='#entity-info'>Discover Node Information</link>.</li>
  </ul>

        <!-- =================== MAYS and SHOULDS =================== -->
  <p>Some of the possible uses of a Jabber-based pubsub service will require other features, but these features are OPTIONAL and therefore not mandatory for compliance with this specification. However, if these features are implemented, they MUST adhere to the protocol described herein in to be compliant. These features include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A service MAY cache the last item published to a node (even if the "persistent-items" option is set to false); if it does default "cache-last-item" to true, it SHOULD send the last published item (or notification thereof) to subscribed entities based on configuration of the "send_last_published_item" field.</li>
    <li>A node owner SHOULD be able to specify who may subscribe to a node.</li>
    <li>A node owner SHOULD be able to specify who may publish to a node.</li>
    <li>A node MAY be configured to deliver the published payload inside the event notification.</li>
    <li>A node MAY be configured to persist published items to some persistent storage mechanism.</li>
    <li>A node MAY be configured to persist only a limited number of items.</li>
    <li>A service MAY support collections.</li>
    <li>A service or node MAY support extended service discovery information (meta-data).</li>
  </ul>

  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Event Types' anchor='events'>
    <p>The requirements for the publish-subscribe protocol imply that there are two major dimensions along which we can measure events: persistent vs. transient, and pure notification vs. inclusion of payload. An implementation SHOULD enable an owner to configure a node along both of these dimensions.</p>
    <p>No matter whether a node is configured for persistent or transient events, a service MAY cache the last item published to the node, in which case it SHOULD send that item to subscribers based on configuration of the "send_last_published_item" option (see the <link url='#impl-caching'>Item Caching</link> section of this document); if the service supports the "http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub#last-published" feature then the value of this option MUST default to "on_sub_and_presence" (though the service SHOULD allow the node owner to override the default).</p>
    <p>A pubsub service MUST validate publish requests against the configuration of the node along both of these dimensions (see the <link url='#publisher-publish'>Publish An Item to a Node</link> section of this document for the relevant error conditions).</p>
    <p>Whether an item must be provided by the publisher, and whether an item ID is provided by the publisher or generated by the pubsub service, depends on the type of event being published. We can summarize the relevant rules as follows:</p>
    <table caption='Event Types, Items, and Item IDs'>
      <tr><th>&#160;</th><th>Notification</th><th>Payload</th></tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Persistent</strong></td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Transient</strong></td>
        <td>Publisher MUST NOT include an &ITEM; element (therefore item ID is neither provided nor generated) but the notification will include an empty &ITEMS; element</td>
        <td>Publisher MUST include an &ITEM; element that contains the payload, but the item ID is OPTIONAL</td>

        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>

        <td>Open</td>
        <td>Any entity may subscribe to the node (i.e., without the necessity for subscription approval) and any entity may retrieve items from the node (i.e., without being subscribed); this SHOULD be the default access model for generic pubsub services.</td>

        <td>Any entity with a subscription of type "from" or "both" may subscribe to the node and retrieve items from the node; this access model applies mainly to instant messaging systems (see <cite>RFC 3921</cite>).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Roster</td>
        <td>Any entity in the specified roster group(s) may subscribe to the node and retrieve items from the node; this access model applies mainly to instant messaging systems (see <cite>RFC 3921</cite>).</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Whitelist</td>
        <td>An entity may be subscribed only through being added to a whitelist by the node owner (unsolicited subscription requests are rejected), and only subscribers may retrieve items from the node. In effect, the default affiliation is outcast. The node owner MUST automatically be on the whitelist. In order to add entities to the whitelist, the node owner SHOULD use the protocol specified in the <link url='#owner-affiliations'>Manage Affiliated Entities</link> section of this document.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>A generic publish-subscribe implementation SHOULD support all of the defined access models, although specialized publish-subscribe implementations MAY support only a subset of the access models. Which access models are provided in a particular deployment is a matter of service provisioning (e.g., some restricted deployments may wish to lock down permissions so that only the "authorize" and "whitelist" access models are provided, or even only the "whitelist" access model).</p>
    <p>A node creator or owner can override the default access model by specifying an appropriate value for the 'pubsub#access_model' configuration field (see the <link url='#owner-create'>Create a Node With Default Configuration</link> and <link url='#owner-configure'>Configure a Node</link> sections of this document).</p>
  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Addressing' anchor='addressing'>
    <p>If a pubsub node is addressable, it MUST be addressable either (1) as a JID or (2) as the combination of a JID and a node. <note>These nodes are equivalent to those used in <cite>XEP-0030: Service Discovery</cite>.</note></p>
    <section3 topic='JID' anchor='addressing-jid'>
      <p>If a pubsub node is addressable as a JID, the NodeID MUST be the resource identifier, and MUST NOT be specified by the "user" portion (node identifier) of the JID (e.g. "domain.tld/NodeID" and "user@domain.tld/NodeID" are allowed; "NodeID@domain.tld" is not allowed <note>This rule does not apply to the root collection node, if any.</note>). JID addressing SHOULD be used when interacting with a pubsub node using a protocol that does not support the node attribute. For example, when a service makes it possible for entities to subscribe to nodes via presence, it would address nodes as JIDs. If a pubsub node is addressable as a JID, the pubsub service MUST ensure that the NodeID conforms to the Resourceprep profile of Stringprep as described in <cite>RFC 3920</cite>.</p>
      <p>Consider the following example, in which the pubsub service is located at the hostname pubsub.shakespeare.lit.</p>

    <section3 topic='JID+NodeID' anchor='addressing-jidnode'>
      <p>If a pubsub node is addressable as a JID plus node, the NodeID MUST be the value of both the Service Discovery 'node' attribute and the pubsub 'node' attribute; i.e., for discovery purposes, a pubsub node is equivalent to a Service Discovery node. If a pubsub node is addressable as a JID plus node, the pubsub service SHOULD ensure that the NodeID conforms to the Resourceprep profile of Stringprep as described in <cite>RFC 3920</cite>.</p>

  <section2 topic='Discover Nodes' anchor='entity-nodes'>
    <p>If a service implements a hierarchy of nodes (by means of <link url='#collections'>Collection Nodes</link>), it MUST also enable entities to discover the nodes in that hierarchy by means of the <strong>Service Discovery</strong> protocol, subject to the recommendations in <cite>XEP-0030</cite> regarding large result sets (for which &xep0055; or some other protocol SHOULD be used). The following examples show the use of service discovery in discovering the nodes available at a hierarchical pubsub service.</p>

    <p>To discover the published items which exist on the service for a specific node, an entity MAY send a "disco#items" request to the node itself, and the service MAY return each item as a Service Discovery &ITEM; element. The 'name' attribute of each Service Discovery item MUST contain its ItemID and the item MUST NOT possess a 'node' attribute.

<section1 topic='Subscriber Use Cases' anchor='subscriber'>

  <p>This section defines the use cases for and protocols to be used by potential and actual subscribers. (Note: The <link url='#impl'>Implementation Notes</link> section of this document describes many important factors and business rules which a pubsub service MUST observe. In addition, the examples throughout assume the existence of a separate pubsub component and include any relevant 'from' addresses as stamped by a server or network edge.)</p>

  <section2 topic='Subscribe to a Node' anchor='subscriber-subscribe'>
    <section3 topic='Request' anchor='subscriber-subscribe-request'>
      <p>When a Jabber entity wishes to subscribe to a node, it sends a subscription request to the pubsub service. The subscription request is an IQ-set where the &lt;pubsub/&gt; element contains one and only one &lt;subscribe/&gt; element. The &lt;subscribe/&gt; element MUST possess a 'node' attribute specifying the node to which the entity wishes to subscribe. The &lt;subscribe/&gt; element MUST also possess a 'jid' attribute specifying the exact XMPP address to be used as the subscribed JID -- often a bare JID (&BAREJID;) or full JID (&FULLJID;), although JIDs of the form &DOMAIN; or &DOMAINRES; may subscribe as well.</p>
      <p>Here is an example of a subscription request.</p>
      <example caption='Entity subscribes to a node'><![CDATA[

    </section3>
    <section3 topic='Error Cases' anchor='subscriber-subscribe-error'>
      <p>There are several reasons why the subscription request might fail:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The bare JID portions of the JIDs do not match.</li>
        <li>The node has an access model of "presence" and the requesting entity is not subscribed to the owner's presence.</li>
        <li>The node has an access model of "roster" and the requesting entity is not in one of the authorized roster groups.</li>
        <li>The node has an access model of "whitelist" and the requesting entity is not on the whitelist.</li>
        <li>The service requires payment for subscriptions to the node.</li>
        <li>The requesting entity is anonymous and the service does not allow anonymous entities to subscribe.</li>
        <li>The requesting entity has a pending subscription.</li>
        <li>The requesting entity is blocked from subscribing (e.g., because having an affiliation of outcast).</li>
        <li>The node does not support subscriptions.</li>
        <li>The node does not exist.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>These error cases are described more fully in the following sections.</p>
      <section4 topic='JIDs Do Not Match' anchor='subscriber-subscribe-error-nomatch'>
        <p>If the specified JID is a bare JID or full JID, the service MUST at a minimum check the bare JID portion against the bare JID portion of the 'from' attribute on the received IQ request to make sure that the requesting entity has the same identity as the JID which is being requested to be added to the subscriber list.</p>
        <p>If the bare JID portions of the JIDs do not match as described above and the requesting entity does not have some kind of admin or proxy privilege as defined by the implementation, the service MUST return a &badrequest; error, which SHOULD also include a pubsub-specific error condition of &lt;invalid-jid/&gt;.</p>

        <p>Note: An implementation MAY enable the service administrator to configure a list of entities that are excluded from this check; those entities may be considered "trusted proxies" that are allowed to subscribe on behalf of other entities. In the same way, implementations MAY enable blacklisting of entities that are not allowed to perform specific operations (such as subscribing or creating nodes).</p>

It is NOT RECOMMENDED for clients to generate SubIDs, since collisions might result; therefore a service SHOULD generate the SubID on behalf of the subscriber and MAY overwrite SubIDs if they are provided by subscribers. If the service does not allow multiple subscriptions for the same entity and it receives an additional subscription request, the service MUST return the current subscription state (as if the subscription was just approved).</p>

    <p>Implementations of pubsub that choose to persist items MAY allow entities to request existing items from a node (e.g., an entity may wish to do this after successfully subscribing in order to receive all the items in the publishing history for the node).</p>
    <section3 topic='Permissions' anchor='subscriber-retrieve-perms'>

      <ul>
        <li><p>If the access model is "open", the service SHOULD allow any entity (whether or not it is subscribed) to retrieve items.</p></li>
        <li><p>If the access model is "presence", the service SHOULD allow any entity that is subscribed to the owner's presence to retrieve items.</p></li>
        <li><p>If the access model is "roster", the service SHOULD allow any entity that is subscribed to the owner's presence and contained in the relevant roster group(s) to retrieve items.</p></li>
        <li><p>If the access model is "authorize" or "whitelist", the service MUST allow only subscribed entities to retrieve items.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The only exception foreseen to the SHOULD requirements for the foregoing access models is the enforcement of local privacy and security policies as specified more fully in the <link url='#security'>Security Considerations</link> section of this document.

      <p>Any entity that is allowed to publish items to a node (i.e., a publisher or an owner) may do so at any time by sending an IQ-set to the service containing a pubsub element with a &lt;publish/&gt; child.</p>
      <p>The syntax is as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The &lt;publish/&gt; element MUST possess a 'node' attribute, specifying the NodeID of the node.</li>
        <li>Depending on the node configuration, the &lt;publish/&gt; element MAY contain no &ITEM; elements, one &ITEM; element, or (for <link url='#impl-batch'>Batch Processing</link>) more than one &ITEM; element. <note>It is not necessary for a publication request to include a payload or even an &ITEM; element in order to trigger a notification. For example, the result of publishing to a transient, notification-only node will be a notification that does not include even an &ITEM; element. However, for the sake of convenience we refer to the act of publication as "publishing an item" (rather than, say, "triggering a notification") even though a publication request will not always contain an &ITEM; element.</note></li>
        <li>The &lt;item/&gt; element provided by the publisher MAY possess an 'id' attribute, specifying a unique ItemID for the item. If an ItemID is not provided in the publish request, the pubsub service MUST generate one and MUST ensure that it is unique for that node.</li>

      <p>An entity may want to create a new node. Support for this feature ("create-nodes") is RECOMMENDED. However, a service MAY disallow creation of nodes based on the identity of the requesting entity, or MAY disallow node creation altogether (e.g., reserving that privilege to a service-wide administrator).</p>
      <p>There are two ways to create a node:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Create a node with default configuration for the specified node type.</li>
        <li>Create and configure a node simultaneously.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>These methods, along with method-specific error conditions, are explained more fully in the following sections.</p>
      <p>In addition to method-specific error conditions, there are several general reasons why the node creation request might fail:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The service does not support node creation.</li>
        <li>Only entities that are registered with the service are allowed to create nodes but the requesting entity is not registered.</li>
        <li>The requesting entity does not have sufficient privileges to create nodes.</li>
        <li>The requested NodeID already exists.</li>
        <li>The request did not include a NodeID and "instant nodes" are not supported.</li>

      <p>These general error cases are described more fully below.</p>

      <p>Note: When a service successfully creates a node on behalf of the requesting entity, it MUST return an IQ result. If the node creation request did not specify a NodeID and the service supports creation of instant nodes, the service MUST specify the created NodeID in the IQ result. Similarly, if the node creation request specified a NodeID but the service modified the NodeID before creating the node as described in the <link url='#collections'>Collection Nodes</link> section of this document, the service MUST also specify the modified node in the IQ result. In all other cases, the service MUST NOT specify the NodeID in the IQ result (since the node creator can determine which node was created by tracking the 'id' attribute that it specified for the IQ-set).</p>

    <section3 topic='Create a Node With Default Configuration' anchor='owner-create-default'>
      <p>As explained above, each node type has its own default configuration. By asking the service to create a node with default configuration, the node creator accepts the default configuration. If the service allows node configuration, the owner may reconfigure the node after creating the node (as described in the <link url='#owner-configure'>Configure a Node</link> section of this document). In addition, a service MAY allow entities to determine the default configuration options for a given node type before creating a node (as described in the <link url='#owner-default'>Request Default Configurations</link> section of this document).</p>
      <p>In order to create a node with default configuration, the node creator MUST include an empty &lt;configure/&gt; child element in the creation request. The node creator MAY specify values for the 'pubsub#node_type' and 'pubsub#access_model' configuration fields or MAY accept the defaults, which are "leaf" for the 'pubsub#node_type' field and the value represented by the 'pubsub#access_model' field (i.e., "authorize", "open", "presence", "roster", or "whitelist").</p>
      <p>In the following example, the node creator requests a leaf node (the default type) with an open access model (assumed to be the default type for this service).</p>

<section1 topic='Collection Nodes' anchor='collections'>

  <p>A pubsub service MAY support collection nodes as well as leaf nodes. Collections enable nodes to be grouped together in any way, including hierarchies and directed acyclic graphs. Collections MUST contain only leaf nodes and/or other collections. Collections MUST NOT contain published items, since only leaf nodes are allowed to contain items (therefore a collection MUST NOT support the "publish" feature or related features such as "persistent-items"). If collections are supported, a service MUST advertise that fact in its "disco#info" responses by including a feature of "pubsub#collections" and MUST support service discovery of child nodes as described in the <link url='#entity-nodes'>Discover Nodes</link> section of this document.</p>

  <section2 topic='Subscribe to a Collection Node' anchor='collections-subscribe'>
    <p>A service that implements collection nodes SHOULD allow entities to subscribe to collection nodes (subject to access models and local security policies).</p>
    <p>In addition to the subscription configuration options already defined, there are two subscription configuration options specific to collection nodes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>pubsub#subscription_type</strong></p>
        <p>This subscription option enables the subscriber to subscribe either to items or to nodes.</p>
        <p>If the subscription type is "items", the subscriber shall be notified whenever any node contained in the collection generates a notification (e.g., when an item is published or deleted), as modified by the value of the "pubsub#subscription_depth" option.</p>
        <p>If the subscription type is "nodes", the subscriber shall be notified whenever a new node is added to the collection, as modified by the value of the "pubsub#subscription_depth" option.</p>
        <p>The default value of this subscription option MUST be "nodes".</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>pubsub#subscription_depth</strong></p>
        <p>This subscription option enables the subscriber to specify whether it wants to receive notifications only from first-level children of the collection (a value of "1") or from all descendents (a value of "all").</p>
        <p>For subscriptions of type "items", this enables the subscriber to be informed only when an item is published to a leaf node that is a direct child of the collection node to which it has subscribed, or to be informed whenever an item is published to any leaf node in the "tree" that begins at the level of the collection to which it has subscribed.</p>
        <p>For subscriptions of type "nodes", this enables the subscriber to be informed only when a new node is added in the specific collection to which it has subscribed, or to be informed whenever a node is added anywhere in the "tree" that begins at the level of the collection to which it has subscribed.</p>
        <p>The default value of this subscription option MUST be "1".</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In order to subscribe to a collection node, an entity MUST send a subscription request to the node; the subscription request MAY include subscription options, but this is not strictly necessary (especially if the entity does not wish to override the default settings for the "pubsub#subscription_type" and "pubsub#subscription_depth" options).</p>
    <example caption='Entity subscribes to a collection node (no configuration)'><![CDATA[

   </options>
 </pubsub>
</iq>
    ]]></example>
    <p>The subscriber will now receive item notifications from nodes at any depth within the "blogs" collection.</p>
    <p>Depending on the nature of the node "tree", a subscription type of "items" and depth of "all" may result in an extremely large number of notifications. Therefore, a service MAY disallow such a combination of subscription options, in which case it MUST return a &notallowed; error to the requesting entity.</p>
    <p>A service MAY allow an entity to subscribe to a collection node in two ways, once with a subscription of type "nodes" (to receive notification of any new nodes added to the collection or the entire tree) and once with a subscription of type "items" (to receive all items published within the tree). However, a service SHOULD NOT allow an entity to subscribe twice to a collection node (once with a subscription depth of "1" and once with a subscription depth of "all") for the same subscription type, since two such subscriptions are unnecessary (a depth of "all" includes by definition a depth of "1"); in this case the service SHOULD return a &conflict; error to the requesting entity.</p>
  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Root Collection Node' anchor='collections-root'>
    <p>A service that implements collections SHOULD support a root collection. The root collection shall be identified by the lack of a node identifier (i.e., the address of the pubsub service itself, such as "pubsub.shakespeare.lit").</p>
    <p>Subscribing to this node with a subscription of type "nodes" and a depth of "1" enables an entity to be notified whenever a new first-level node is created at the pubsub service. Subscribing to this node with a subscription of type "nodes" and a depth of "all" enables an entity to be notified whenever a new node is created anywhere at the pubsub service.</p>
    <example caption='Entity subscribes to the root collection node'><![CDATA[

</iq>
    ]]></example>
    <p>In order to send notification of new nodes, the service shall send an event that contains a &lt;collection/&gt; element that in turns contains a &lt;node/&gt; element whose 'id' attribute specifies the NodeID of the new node.</p>

        <p>An implementation MAY allow a node to be associated with more than one collection node and therefore MAY specify a type of "text-multi" for the "pubsub#collection" field. However, in order to reduce the complexity of implementation, it is RECOMMENDED to allow only one parent collection node for each node and therefore it is RECOMMENDED to specify a type of "text-single" for the "pubsub#collection" field. If a service supports associating a node with multiple collections, it MUST advertise support for the "multi-collection" feature (if that feature is not advertised, entities SHOULD assume that the service allows a node to be associated with only one collection). If the request specifies more than one collection node but the service allows a node to be associated with only one collection node, the service MUST return a &badrequest; error.</p>

<section1 topic='IM Account Integration' anchor='presence'>
  <p>Publish-subscribe functionality can be integrated into existing instant messaging and presence services (see <cite>RFC 3921</cite>), such that each registered account functions as a virtual pubsub service (sometimes called "pubsub-on-a-JID"). In such deployments, the root pubsub node for each virtual pubsub service has the same address as the bare JID (&BAREJID;) of the account, which is typically associated with an IM user (e.g., &lt;hamlet@denmark.lit&gt;). Since an IM user typically has a roster of "buddies" and shares presence information with those buddies, the virtual pubsub service can use roster and presence information to provide some helpful shortcuts for subscribers, in particular the auto-subscribe and filtered-notifications features described in this section.</p>
  <section2 topic='Auto-Subscribe' anchor='auto-subscribe'>
    <p>When a contact is affiliated with the account owner through sharing of XMPP presence, the "auto-subscribe" feature greatly simplifies the subscription process. In particular, support for the "auto-subscribe" has the following implications:</p>
    <section3 topic='Account Owner' anchor='auto-subscribe-owner'>
      <p>Because the account owner itself is implicitly subscribed to its own XMPP presence (e.g., each XMPP resource receives presence information from all of the account owner's resources), a service MUST consider the account owner to have a pubsub subscription to the account owner's root collection node with a subscription_type of "items" and a subscription_depth of "all". This is true for all access models.</p>
    </section3>
    <section3 topic='Presence Subscriber' anchor='auto-subscribe-contact'>
      <p>If an entity (i.e., an IM contact) has an XMPP presence subscription to the account owner's bare JID (&BAREJID;), a service MUST consider the contact to have a pubsub subscription to the account owner's root collection node with a subscription_type of "items" and a subscription_depth of "all" if:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The node has an access model of "open".</li>
        <li>The node has an access model of "presence".</li>
        <li>The node has an access model of "roster" and the contact is in the specified roster group.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Note: When an IM contact has a subscription to the account owner's presence, the automated pubsub subscription MUST be based on the JID contained in the 'from' address of the presence subscription request, which for an IM contact will be a bare JID (&BAREJID;).</p>
    </section3>
    <section3 topic='Presence Sharer' anchor='auto-subscribe-directed'>
      <p>If the node has an open access model, the pubsub service SHOULD also consider an entity to be (temporarily) subscribed to the node if the entity sends presence to the account owner in the absence of a presence subscription. In this case, the subscription SHOULD be based on the 'from' address of the presence stanza, which will be a full JID (&FULLJID;). When the service receives unavailable presence from the full JID, it MUST consider cancel the (temporary) subscription.</p>
    </section3>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Filtered Notifications' anchor='filtered-notifications'>
    <p>A contact may not want to receive notifications for all payload types. A contact SHOULD signal its preferences to the account owner's server by including <cite>XEP-0115</cite> information that specifies the namespaces for which the contact wishes to receive notifications (if any). This information is used by a pubsub service that supports the "filtered-notifications" feature to send only those payload types that the subscriber wishes to receive.</p>
    <p>In order to make this possible, all possible payload namespaces can be appended with the string "+notify" to indicate that the contact wishes to receive notifications for the payload format. Thus if Romeo wants to receive notifications for location data and tune data but not activity data, his client would advertise support for the following namespaces in the disco#info results it sends: <note>Including, say, the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/geoloc' namespace indicates that the client understands the geolocation namespace, whereas including the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/geoloc+notify' namespace indicates that the client wishes to receive notifications related to geolocation.</note></p>
    <ul>
      <li>http://jabber.org/protocol/geoloc+notify</li>
      <li>http://jabber.org/protocol/tune+notify</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This set of namespaces would then be advertised by including the namespace in the identity+features hash encapsulated via the 'ver' attribute as described in <cite>XEP-0115</cite>.</p>
    <example caption='Contact sends presence with caps'><![CDATA[
<presence from='romeo@montague.lit/orchard'>
  <c xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/caps'
     node='http://www.chatopus.com/#2.2'
     ver='AFBT0mPr29zQE5aGtCJp97CIS6E='/>
</presence>
    ]]></example>
    <p>It is the responsibility of the account owner's server to cache <cite>XEP-0115</cite> information. When the server receives presence from a contact, it MUST check that presence information for entity capabilities data and correlate that data with the desired namespaces for the contact's client. The server MUST NOT send notifications related to any data formats that the contact's client has not asked for via the relevant "namespace+notify" disco#info feature. This enables a client to turn off all notifications (e.g., because of bandwidth restrictions) and to easily receive all desired data formats simply by adding support for the appropriate "namespace+notify" combination in its disco#info results and client capabililies. However, it also implies that a client can request notifications only on a global basis and cannot request, say, mood information only from certain contacts in the user's roster. Community consensus is that this is an acceptable tradeoff. Also, note that this works only if the account owner has a presence subscription to the contact and the contact has a presence subscription to the account owner.</p>
    <p>Some examples may help to illustrate the concept of notification filtering. Here we show presence generated by two of the contacts listed above (benvolio@montague.lit does not have any presence subscriptions to or from juliet@capulet.lit and therefore is not involved in these protocol flows).</p>

<section1 topic='Implementation Notes' anchor='impl'>

  <section2 topic='Intended Recipients for Notifications' anchor='impl-recipients'>
    <p>When a pubsub service generates notifications, it MUST adhere to the delivery rules implicit in the subscription option configuration for each subscriber. In particular, the 'to' address SHOULD be that of the subscribed JID only. The service SHOULD NOT attempt to guess at the most available resource associated with the subscribed JID (e.g., in the context of instant messaging systems).</p>
  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Handling Notification-Related Errors' anchor='impl-bounce'>
    <p>As noted above, a pubsub service SHOULD ensure that the &MESSAGE; stanza for each event notification it generates possesses an 'id' attribute with a unique value. (This notification ID is not to be confused with either the node ID or the item ID.) This ID MUST be unique within the context of the pubsub service in order to ensure proper tracking of any delivery-related errors.</p>
    <p>Exactly how a service shall handle delivery-related errors is a matter of implementation. In general, such handling is effectively similar to the bounce processing performed by other message delivery systems, such as mail transfer agents and mailing list software. The following are some suggested guidelines regarding the handling of XMPP-specific error conditions in relation to pubsub event notifications (see <cite>RFC 3920</cite> and <cite>XEP-0086</cite> regarding XMPP error condition semantics):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the XMPP error is of type "cancel" (e.g., &notfound;), or the error condition is &gone;, the pubsub service SHOULD terminate the subscription of the entity to that node and MAY terminate the subscription of that entity to all nodes hosted at the service.</li>
      <li>If the XMPP error is of type "auth" (e.g., &registration;) or "wait" (e.g., &timeout;), or the error condition is &badrequest;, &redirect;, or &notacceptable;, the pubsub service SHOULD increment a bounce counter for that entity and MAY attempt to resend the event notification after some configurable amount of time. The service MAY terminate the subscription of the entity to that node if the bounce counter has reached some configurable limit.</li>
    </ul>
  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Presence-Based Delivery of Events' anchor='impl-presence'>
    <p>Implementations of pubsub MAY deliver event notifications only when the subscriber is online. In these cases, the option may be a node configuration option as shown in the examples above. To facilitate this, the pubsub service needs to subscribe to the subscriber's presence and check the subscriber's current presence information before sending any event notifications (as described in <cite>RFC 3921</cite>). Presence subscriptions MUST be based on the subscribed JID.</p>
  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Not Routing Events to Offline Storage' anchor='impl-offline'>
    <p>Sending events to users of existing Jabber servers may force event notifications to be routed to offline storage for later delivery (as described in &xep0160;). This may not always be desirable. The possible ways of preventing this behavior include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use presence-based subscription options as described above.</li>
      <li>Use delivery semantics as defined by &xep0079;.</li>
      <li>Specify a message type of "headline", which in most existing server implementations will prevent offline storage.</li>
    </ul>
  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Including a Message Body' anchor='impl-body'>
    <p>If a service understands the semantics for a particular payload type and an entity's subscription is so configured (via the "pubsub#include_body" option), the service SHOULD include an appropriate XMPP &BODY; child element along with the payloads it sends in event notifications for a given node, where the body's XML character data summarizes or represents the information contained in the payload (this enables clients that do not understand the payload format to present the appropriate information to an end user). For example, the Atom &lt;summary/&gt; element (see <cite>RFC 4287</cite>) could be mapped to the XMPP &BODY; element. A service MUST NOT provide the "pubsub#include_body" subscription option for a node if it does not have a defined way to transform part or all of the payload format into a sensible message body. A node owner MAY define an XSLT for transforming the payload format into a message body, via the "pubsub#body_xslt" node configuration option.</p>
    <p>If the service does not understand the semantics for a particular payload type, it MAY include a &lt;body/&gt; child whose XML character data informs the subscriber that the message contains an event notification (e.g., text such as "This message contains an event notification" would be appropriate).</p>
  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Node ID and Item ID Uniqueness' anchor='impl-uniqueness'>
    <p>NodeIDs MUST be treated as unique identifiers within the context of a particular pubsub service.</p>
    <p>If item identifiers are used, they MUST be treated as unique within the scope of the node. The combination of the NodeID + ItemID MUST be unique within a given service, and MUST specify a single published item at a single node.</p>
    <p>If a publisher publishes an item and the ItemID matches that of an existing item, the pubsub service MUST overwrite the existing item and generate a new event notification.</p>
    <p>Because it is possible for a node's configuration to change such that ItemIDs are required (e.g., a change from transient to persistent), a service SHOULD use ItemIDs for internal tracking purposes even if it does not include them with the notifications it generates prior to the configuration change.</p>
  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Item Caching' anchor='impl-caching'>
    <p>A service MAY cache the last item published to a node, even if the node is configured for transient publication (i.e., configured to not persist items). The last published item SHOULD be sent to new subscribers upon successful processing of a subscription request or approval by a node owner.</p>
    <p>Note: If a publisher requests <link url='#impl-batch'>Batch Processing</link> of item publications, the concept of "last published item" is undefined; therefore, if information coherence is needed, a publisher SHOULD publish items in separate requests rather than in batch mode.</p>
    <p>Note: Particular profiles of the generic publish-subscribe protocol MAY define more stringent requirements regarding the "cache-last-item" feature.</p>
  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Batch Processing' anchor='impl-batch'>
    <p>A publisher MAY include multiple &ITEM; elements in a publish request and MAY include multiple &ITEM; elements in a retract request. This results in "batch processing" of publications or retractions. If the service cannot process any one of the items to be published or retracted, the entire batch MUST fail. Also note that batch publication renders the concept of "last published item" problematic; therefore, if information coherence is needed, a publisher SHOULD publish items in separate requests rather than in batch mode.</p>
  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Auto-Subscribing Owners and Publishers' anchor='impl-autosubscribe'>
    <p>A service MUST allow owners and publishers to subscribe to a node, and to retrieve items from a node even if they are not subscribed. A service MAY auto-subscribe owners and publishers if they are not already subscribed, in which case it SHOULD generate a subscription ID if necessary for the subscription and SHOULD send a notification of successful subscription as described in the <link url='#impl-subchange'>Notification of Subscription State Changes</link> section of this document.</p>
  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Authorizing Subscription Requests (Pending Subscribers)' anchor='impl-authorize'>
    <p>How subscription requests are sent to node owners is a matter of implementation. Possibilities include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Send requests to all owners (these may be placed in offline storage as described in <cite>XEP-0160</cite>) and first approval wins.</li>
      <li>The service could subscribe to owner presence, and send only to the owners that are online.</li>
      <li>All owners vote on the new subscriber.</li>
      <li>Any owner is allowed to veto the subscriber.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>An implementation MAY use any of these methods, or some other method not defined herein.</p>
  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Notification of Subscription State Changes' anchor='impl-subchange'>
    <p>Various actions and events may result in changes to a subscription state:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Approval or denial of a subscription request as described in the <link url='#owner-subreq'>Manage Subscription Requests</link> use case</p></li>
      <li><p>Cancellation of an existing subscription, for which many "triggers" are possible:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The entity simply unsubscribes from the node</li>
          <li>The node is of type "presence" and the underlying presence subscription is cancelled</li>
          <li>The node is of type "roster" and the entity is moved to an unauthorized roster group</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When a subscription state change occurs, a service SHOULD send a message to the (new, former, or denied) subscriber informing it of the change, where the message contains an &lt;event/&gt; element with a single &lt;subscription/&gt; child that specifies the node, JID, and subscription state. The notification MAY contain a &BODY; element specifying natural-language text regarding the subscription change. Examples are shown below.</p>
    <example caption='Subscription approval notification'><![CDATA[
<message
    from='pubsub.shakespeare.lit'
    to='horatio@denmark.lit'
    id='approvalnotify1'>
  <event xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub#event'>
    <subscription node='princely_musings' jid='horatio@denmark.lit' subscription='subscribed'/>
  </event>
</message>
    ]]></example>
    <example caption='Subscription cancellation / denial notification'><![CDATA[
<message

    <subscription node='princely_musings' jid='horatio@denmark.lit' subscription='none'/>
  </event>
</message>
    ]]></example>
    <p>If the service has knowledge of the (former or denied) subscriber's presence, it SHOULD send the message to all of the subscriber's resources; if not, it MUST send the message to the subscriber's affiliated JID.</p>
    <p>If a service or node supports this feature, it MUST return a feature of "subscription-notifications" in its response to service discovery information requests.</p>
  </section2>

  <section2 topic='NodeID Semantics' anchor='impl-semantics'>
    <p>NodeIDs MAY have semantic meaning in particular profiles, implementations, or deployments of pubsub. However, it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that such semantic meaning not be used to encapsulate the hierarchical structure of nodes; instead, node hierarchy SHOULD be encapsulated using collections and their associated child nodes.</p>
  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Multiple Node Discovery' anchor='impl-multiple'>
    <p>A user may publish information that adheres to a certain profile at multiple pubsub nodes, and a potential subscriber may want to discover all of these pubsub nodes. The user may make a list of pubsub nodes publicly available for querying even when the user is offline by using the Service Discovery mechanism for "publishing" items (see Section 4 of <cite>XEP-0030</cite>). The potential subscriber may then send a "disco#items" request to the user's bare JID (&lt;user@host&gt;), including the 'node' attribute set to the value of the namespace to which the desired information adheres. The user's server then returns a list of pubsub nodes that meet that criterion (with each pubsub node being a separate Service Discovery item). Here is an example.</p>
    <example caption='Discovering multiple nodes'><![CDATA[
<iq type='get'
    from='francisco@denmark.lit/barracks'
    to='hamlet@denmark.lit'
    id='multi-1'/>
  <query xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/disco#items'
         node='http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom'/>
</iq>

<iq type='result'
    from='hamlet@denmark.lit'
    to='francisco@denmark.lit/barracks'
    id='multi-1'/>
  <query xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/disco#items'
         node='http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom'>
    <item jid='pubsub.shakespeare.lit'
          node='princely_musings'
          name='Princely Musings (Atom)'/>
    <item jid='thepub.denmark.lit'
          node='feed-o-rama'
          name='Backup feed'/>
  </query>
</iq>
    ]]></example>
    <p>Alternatively, a user may be registered with a server that offers personal eventing services, in which case the user will have one node per namespace as described in <cite>XEP-0163</cite>.</p>
  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Inclusion of SHIM Headers' anchor='impl-shim'>
    <p>When SubIDs are used, <cite>Stanza Headers and Internet Metadata (SHIM)</cite> headers are to be included in order to differentiate notifications sent regarding a particular subscription. The relevant use cases and scenarios are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sending notifications regarding newly-published items as described in the <link url='#publisher-publish'>Publish an Item to a Node</link> use case.</li>
      <li>Sending notifications regarding deleted items as described in the <link url='#publisher-delete'>Delete an Item from a Node</link> use case.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The SHIM headers are generated by the node to which the subscriber has a subscription, which may be either a leaf node or a collection node.</p>
    <p>SHIM headers are not to be included when the content does not differ based on subscription ID, e.g., when a node sends notification of a configuration change to the node itself, notification that the node has been purged, or notification that the node has been deleted.</p>
  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Associating Events and Payloads with the Generating Entity' anchor='impl-association'>
    <p>An implementation MAY enable the node configuration to specify an association between the event notification and the entity to which the published information pertains, but such a feature is OPTIONAL. Here are some possible examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In the context of a geolocation notification service using &xep0080;, the user may generate the geolocation information or the information may be generated by an automated service (e.g., a service offered by a mobile telephony provider), but in either case the information is <em>about</em> the user's geolocation and therefore all replies should go to the user (who is probably the node owner).</li>
      <li>In the context of a group weblog, different users might publish to the weblog and replies might go to the publisher of an entry rather than to the weblog owner.</li>
      <li>In the context of an integrated pubsub and multi-user chat system, the node owner might be the room owner but all replies need to be sent to the room rather than to the owner.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Therefore we define three node configuration options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>pubsub#itemreply -- the per-item policy for replies (the value is "owner" or "publisher").</li>
      <li>pubsub#replyto -- the specific user JID(s) to which replies should be sent.</li>
      <li>pubsub#replyroom -- the multi-user chat room to which replies should be sent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A node owner MUST NOT define more than one of these options.</p>
    <p>An example is shown below.</p>

    <p>Alternatively, if a service implements the personal eventing subset of this protocol, the virtual pubsub service is the account owner's bare JID and notifications are sent from that JID; for details, refer to <cite>XEP-0163</cite>.</p>

  <section2 topic='Chaining' anchor='impl-chaining'>
    <p>The word "chaining" refers to the practice of subscribing one node to another node. For instance, consider a scenario in which the node &lt;pubsub@example.net/NewsBroadcaster&gt; wants to distribute information received from the node "NewsFeed" at &lt;pubsub.example.com&gt;. While it is theoretically possible for &lt;pubsub@example.net/NewsBroadcaster&gt; to directly subscribe to the NewsFeed node (since the former node is directly addressable as a JID), implementations MUST NOT chain nodes in this fashion. Instead, implementations MUST subscribe from the address of the pubsub service rather than the node (in the example shown here, the subscription would be sent from &lt;pubsub@example.net&gt; rather than &lt;pubsub@example.net/NewsBroadcaster&gt;).</p>

  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Time-Based Subscriptions (Leases)' anchor='impl-leases'>
    <p>In some systems it may be desirable to provide a subscription "leasing" feature in order to expire old or stale subscriptions. Leases can be implemented using configurable subscription options; specifically, when an entity subscribes, the service would require configuration of subscription options and the configuration form would contain a field of "pubsub#expire". This field MUST contain a dateTime (as specified in &xep0082;).</p>
    <p>The leasing process is shown below.</p>

  <section2 topic='Content-Based Pubsub Systems' anchor='impl-content'>
    <p>A service MAY enable entities to subscribe to nodes and apply a filter to notifications (e.g., keyword matching such as "send me all news entries from Slashdot that match the term 'Jabber'"). Such a content-based service SHOULD allow an entity to subscribe more than once to the same node and, if so, MUST use subscription identifiers (SubIDs) to distinguish between multiple subscriptions. In order to prevent collisions, a service that supports content-based subscriptions using SubIDs SHOULD generate SubIDs on behalf of subscribers rather than allowing subscribers to set their own SubIDs. <note>Another way to implement content-based subscriptions is to host one node per keyword or other filter; however, this is likely to require an extremely large number of nodes.</note></p>
    <p>Content-based services SHOULD use subscription options to specify the filter(s) to be applied. Because there many possible filtering mechanisms (many of which may be application-specific), this document does not define any such method. However, filtering mechanisms may be defined in separate specifications.</p>

  <section2 topic='Field Standardization' anchor='registrar-formtypes'>
    <p>XEP-0068 defines a process for standardizing the fields used within Data Forms scoped by a particular namespace, and the XMPP Registrar maintains a registry of such FORM_TYPES (see &FORMTYPES;). Within pubsub, there are four uses of such forms:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Authorization of subscriptions using the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub#subscribe_authorization' namespace.</li>
      <li>Configuration of subscription options using the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub#subscribe_options' namespace.</li>
      <li>Configuration of a node using the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub#node_config' namespace.</li>
      <li>Setting of meta-data information using the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub#meta-data' namespace.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The registry submissions associated with these namespaces are defined below.</p>
    <p>Note: There is no requirement that configuration fields need to be registered with the XMPP Registrar. However, as specified in Section 3.4 of <cite>XEP-0068</cite>, names of custom (unregistered) fields MUST begin with the characters "x-" if the form itself is scoped by a registered FORM_TYPE.</p>
