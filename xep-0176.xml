<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>&xep0166; defines a framework for negotiating and managing out-of-band data sessions over XMPP. In order to provide a flexible framework, the base Jingle specification defines neither data transport methods nor content formats, leaving that up to separate specifications. The current document defines a transport method for establishing and managing data connections between XMPP entities, using the &ice; methodology currently being developed within the IETF.</p>
  <p>The process for ICE negotiation is largely the same in Jingle as it is in <cite>draft-ietf-mmusic-ice</cite>. There are several differences:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Instead of using SIP as the signalling channel, Jingle uses XMPP as the signalling channel.</li>
    <li>In Jingle, each candidate transport is sent in a separate IQ exchange (rather than sending all candidates at once as in <cite>draft-ietf-mmusic-ice</cite>); this approach takes advantage of the request-response semantics of the XMPP &IQ; stanza type and enables the parties to send higher-priority candidates earlier in the negotiation.</li>
    <li>Syntax from the Session Description Protocol (see &rfc4566;) is mapped to an XML syntax suitable for sending over the XMPP signalling channel.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Note: This document depends on the IETF's Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) specification, which is a work in progress. Every effort has been made to keep this document synchronized with <cite>draft-ietf-mmusic-ice</cite>, for which the latest published version is 12 (hereafter referred to as "&icecur;"). The interested reader is referred to the &icecur; for a detailed description of the ICE methodology, which for the most part this document merely maps to XMPP syntax.</em></p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Requirements' anchor='reqs'>
  <p>The Jingle transport method defined herein is designed to meet the following requirements:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Make it possible to establish and manage out-of-band connections between two XMPP entities, even if they are behind Network Address Translators (NATs) or firewalls.</li>
    <li>Make it relatively easy to implement support in standard Jabber/XMPP clients.</li>
    <li>Where communication with non-XMPP entities is needed, push as much complexity as possible onto server-side gateways between the XMPP network and the non-XMPP network.</li>
  </ol>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Glossary' anchor='terms'>
  <p>The reader is referred to &icecur; for a description of various terms used in the context of ICE. Those terms are not reproduced here.</p>

<section1 topic='Protocol Description' anchor='protocol'>
  <section2 topic='Transport Initiation' anchor='protocol-initiate'>
    <p>In order for the initiator in a Jingle exchange to start the negotiation, it MUST send a Jingle "session-initiate" stanza as described in <cite>XEP-0166</cite>. This stanza MUST include at least one transport method. If the initiator wishes to negotiate the ICE transport, it MUST include an empty &TRANSPORT; child element qualified by the 'http://jabber.org/protocol/jingle/transport/ice' namespace.</p>

    <p>As described in <cite>XEP-0166</cite>, to provisionally accept the session initiation request, the responder returns an IQ-result:</p>

  <section2 topic='ICE Negotiation' anchor='protocol-negotiate'>
    <p>If the responder provisionally accepts the session initiation request as shown above, both initiator and responder MUST immediately negotiate connectivity over the ICE transport by exchanging XML-formatted candidate transports for the channel. This negotiation proceeds immediately in order to maximize the possibility that media can be exchanged as quickly as possible. <note>Concurrent with negotiation of the ICE candidates, it is possible for the initiator and responder to negotiate which content types the session will include, which transport methods will be tried for each content type, etc. Those negotiation flows are shown in <cite>XEP-0166</cite>. This document specifies only negotiation of the ICE transport method.</note></p>
    <p>The candidate syntax and negotiation flow are described below.</p>

    <section3 topic='Negotiation Flow' anchor='protocol-negotiate-flow'>
      <p>The first step in negotiating connectivity is for each client to immediately begin sending candidate transport methods to the other client. These candidates SHOULD be gathered by following the procedure specified in Section 5.1 of &icecur; and prioritized by following the procedure specified in Section 5.2 of &icecur;. Each candidate MUST be sent in a &JINGLE; element with an action of "transport-info".</p>
      <p>If the responder receives and can successfully process a given candidate, it returns an IQ-result (if not, for example because the candidate data is improperly formatted, it returns an error).</p>
      <p>Note well that the responder is only indicating receipt of the candidate, not telling the initiator that the candidate will be used.</p>
      <p>The initiator keeps sending candidates, one after the other (without stopping to receive an acknowledgement of receipt from the responder for each candidate) until it has exhausted its supply of possible or desirable candidate transports. (Because certain candidates may be more "expensive" in terms of bandwidth or processing power, the initiator may not want to advertise their existence unless necessary.) For each candidate, the responder acknowledges receipt.</p>
      <p>At the same time (i.e., immediately after provisionally accepting the session, not waiting for the initiator to begin or finish sending candidates), the responder also begins sending candidates that may work for it. As above, the initiator acknowledges receipt of the candidates.</p>
      <p>As the initiator and responder receive candidates, they probe the various candidate transports for connectivity. In performing these connectivity checks, client SHOULD follow the procedure specified in Section 7 of &icecur;.</p>

<section1 topic='Service Discovery' anchor='disco'>
  <p>If an entity supports this specification, it MUST return a feature of "http://jabber.org/protocol/jingle/transport/ice" in response to &xep0030; information requests.</p>
  <p>As mentioned in the <link url='#deploy'>Deployment Notes</link> of this document, the administrator of an XMPP server may wish to deploy a STUN server in order to ease the process of negotiating use of the Jingle ICE transport. A client can become aware of a STUN server in the following ways:</p>
  <ol start='1'>
    <li>Specified in the default settings for the client (while this may seem sub-optimal, it is acceptable at present because there are so few public STUN servers).</li>
    <li>Manually added by a human user into the client's configuration.</li>
    <li>Discovered via DNS SRV records as specified in Section 9.1 of &rfc3489;.</li>
    <li>Discovered via the XMPP &xep0030; extension.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>It is OPTIONAL for a STUN server to support XMPP for the purpose of service discovery. Therefore, client developers SHOULD NOT depend on the existence of XMPP-aware STUN servers.</p>
  <p>If a STUN server is accessible via XMPP, it SHOULD be advertised by returning an appropriate item in response to service discovery item requests sent to the address of an XMPP server:</p>

  <p>A subsequent service discovery information request to the STUN server MUST result in a response indicating that the STUN server has a service discovery category of "proxy" and type of "stun", as well as advertisement of appropriate service discovery features (because the XMPP interaction is necessary only in order to discover the identity of the STUN server, the only feature that an XMPP-aware STUN server SHOULD advertise is "http://jabber.org/protocol/disco#info".)</p>
