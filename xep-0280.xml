<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>At the time of original writing of this XEP, many XMPP servers handle message stanzas sent to a user@host (or "bare") JID with no resource by delivering that message only to the resource with the highest priority for the target user. Some server implementations, however, have chosen to send these messages to all of the online resources for the target user. If the target user is online with multiple resources when the original message is sent, a conversation ensues on one of the user's devices; if the user subsequently
  switches devices, parts of the conversation may end up on the alternate device, causing the user to be confused, misled, or annoyed.</p>

  <p>This XEP defines an approach for ensuring that all of my devices get both sides of all conversations in order to avoid user confusion.  As a pleasant side-effect, information about the current state of a conversation is shared between all of a user's clients that implement this protocol.</p>
</section1>

<section1 topic='Requirements' anchor='reqs'>
  <ul>
    <li>Large changes SHOULD NOT be required to existing servers</li>
    <li>Clients that do not implement the new protocol MUST be able
    participate in conversations</li>
    <li>Clients that do not implement the new protocol MUST NOT
    receive a large number of new partial conversations</li>
    <li>Clients that do not implement the new protocol MUST NOT
    receive protocol they do not expect</li>
    <li>All clients that turn on the new protocol MUST be able to see
    all inbound chat-type messages.</li>
    <li>All clients that turn on the new protocol MUST be able to see
    all outbound chat-type messages from all of the resources of the
    user, regardless of whether the clients for the other resources
    have implemented the new protocol.</li>
  </ul>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Use Cases' anchor='usecases'>
  <section2 topic='Discovering Support' anchor='disco'>
    <p>If a server implements the Message Carbons capability, it MUST specify the "urn:xmpp:carbons:1" feature in its service discovery information features as specified in &xep0030; or section 6.3 of &xep0115;. Clients SHOULD NOT attempt to enable or disable Carbons if their server does not support this feature.</p>
    <example caption='Client requests information about its own server'><![CDATA[
<iq xmlns='jabber:client'
    type='get'

    id='info1'>

    <feature var='urn:xmpp:carbons:1'/>
...
  </query>
</iq>]]></example>    
  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Enabling Carbons' anchor='enabling'>
    <p>Servers MUST NOT enable the Carbons protocol for a client by default, since unmodified clients might be confused by the new protocol.  When a client wants to participate in the Carbons protocol, it sends an IQ set to enable the protocol.</p>
    <example caption='Client enables Carbons'><![CDATA[
<iq xmlns='jabber:client'
    type='set'
    id='enable1'>
  <enable var='urn:xmpp:carbons:1'/>
</iq>]]></example>
    <p>Carbons will generally be enabled before the client sends the first undirected presence, to ensure that all inbound messages will be delivered according to the Carbon rules.  The server will respond with an IQ result when Carbons are enabled:</p>
    <example caption='Server acknowledges Carbons enablement'><![CDATA[
<iq xmlns='jabber:client'
    type='result'
    id='enable1'/>]]></example>
  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Disabling Carbons' anchor='disabling'>
    <p>Some clients might want to disable Carbons.  An example of this might be a mobile client that wants Carbons when the application is in the foreground, and disabled when it is in the background. To disable Carbons, clients send an IQ set:</p>
    <example caption='Client disables Carbons'><![CDATA[
<iq xmlns='jabber:client'
    type='set'
    id='disable1'>
  <disable var='urn:xmpp:carbons:1'/>
</iq>]]></example>
    <p>The server will respond with an IQ result when Carbons are disabled:</p>
    <example caption='Server acknowledges Carbons enablement'><![CDATA[
<iq xmlns='jabber:client'
    type='result'
    id='disable1'/>]]></example>
  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Error Cases' anchor='errors'>
    <p>Enabling or disabling Carbons may fail in the several ways.  If one of these errors is returned, the server MUST keep the previous state, where the initial state is Carbons disabled.  For example, if the first enable returns an error, the server MUST NOT enable Carbons.</p>
    <section3 topic='bad-request' anchor='bad-request'>
      <p>The sender has sent a stanza containing XML that does not conform to the appropriate schema or that cannot be processed. One example is an IQ stanza that includes an unrecognized value of the 'type' attribute.  Another is changing to the state that is already in effect (enabling Carbons a second time).</p>
      <example caption='Error: bad-request'><![CDATA[
<iq xmlns='jabber:client'
    id='enable1'
    type='error'>
  <error type='modify'>
    <bad-request xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-stanzas'/>
  </error>
</iq>]]></example>
    </section3>
    <section3 topic='feature-not-implemented' anchor='feature-not-implemented'>
      <p>The sender has sent an enable or disable request to a server
      that does not support the protocol.  This SHOULD NOT happen in
      practice, because clients MUST check for server support before
      sending their request.</p>
      <example caption='Error: feature-not-implemented'><![CDATA[
<iq xmlns='jabber:client'
    id='enable1'
    type='error'>
  <error type='cancel'>
    <feature-not-implemented xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-stanzas'/>
  </error>
</iq>]]></example>
    </section3>
    <section3 topic='forbidden'  anchor='forbidden'>
      <p>The sender does is forbidden by policy from enabling or
      disabling Carbons.</p>

    <section3 topic='not-allowed' anchor='not-allowed'>
      <p>The receiver does not allow any entity to turn on Carbons.
      This might occur in a multi-domain deployment, where
      administrators of one domain allow Carbons, but another does

  <section2 topic='Receiving Messages' anchor='inbound'>
    <p>Messages of type chat that are addressed to the bare JID (localpart@domain) MUST be copied by the receiving server to all of the resources for that user that have non-negative presence priority and have not filtered messages through some other means.  The process of making copies is known as "forking."</p>

    <example caption='Juliet sends Romeo an undirected message, which is forked'><![CDATA[
<message xmlns='jabber:client'

</message>

... each of romeo@example.net's resources receives this stanza verbatim
]]></example>

    <p>Messages of type "chat" that are addressed to a full JID (localpart@domain/resource) MUST be sent by the receiving server to the addressed resource, and MUST also be sent to all of the Carbons-enabled resources for the receiving user.  The goal of the copies to Carbons-enabled resources is to allow those clients to have both halves of <strong>*all*</strong> IM conversations, including messages that are sent from clients that lock in to particular resources.</p>
    
    <example caption='Juliet sends Romeo a directed message'><![CDATA[
<message xmlns='jabber:client'

    <p>The copies sent to the Carbon-enabled resources are wrapped using &xep0297;. The wrapping message SHOULD maintain the same 'type' attribute value; the 'from' attribute MUST be the Carbon-enabled user's bare JID (e.g. "localpart@domain"); and the 'to' attribute SHOULD be the full JID of the resource receiving the copy. The content of the wrapping message MUST contain a &lt;forwarded xmlns='urn:xmpp:forward:0'/&gt; which contains the original message (properly namespaced as "jabber:client") and a &lt;received xmlns='urn:xmpp:carbons:1'/&gt; element:</p>

  <section2 topic='Sending Messages' anchor='outbound'>
    <p>Carbons clients want to have copies of messages going in <em>both</em> directions for other resources associated with the same user.  To that end, messages of type "chat" that are sent from any resource MUST be copied by the sending server to each of the resources that have enabled Carbons, but are not the sending resource.</p>

    <example caption='Romeo responds to Juliet'><![CDATA[
<message xmlns='jabber:client'

  <section2 topic='Avoiding Carbons for a single message' anchor='avoiding'>
    <p>Some clients might want to avoid carbons on a single message, while still keeping all of the other semantics of Carbon support. This might be useful for clients sending end-to-end encrypted messages, for example.</p>

    <p>To avoid a message being Carbon-copied to its other resources, the sending client MUST add a private element in the "urn:xmpp:carbons:1" namespace.  When the sending server receives the message, it MUST NOT make carbon copies to the other Carbons-enabled resources, and MUST remove the private element before forwarding the message to the intended recipient.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> use of the private mechanism will lead to partial conversations on other devices.  This is the intended effect.</p>

    <example caption='Romeo sends to Juliet, avoiding Carbon copies'><![CDATA[
<message xmlns='jabber:client'
         to='juliet@example.com'
         from='romeo@example.net/home'

<section1 topic='Business Rules' anchor='rules'>
  <section2 topic='Interaction with Chat States' anchor='chatstates'>
    <p>Note that &xep0085; recommends sending chat state
    notifications as chat type messages, which means that they will be
    subject to Carbon-copying.  This is intentional.</p>
    <p>Additionally, clients that implement Carbons MAY take special use of chat state notifications:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Upon receiving an inbound or outbound <em>gone</em> chat state (as a carbon copy) for a given conversation, that conversation SHOULD be removed from user display as if the user on the copied client had terminated the conversation.  In order to prevent unwanted termination of conversations on other resources, clients SHOULD NOT send <em>gone</em> chat states on logout, but instead SHOULD count on the unavailable presence to convey the change in attention.</li>
      <li>Upon receiving an outbound notification of any chat state other than <em>gone</em>, the copied client MAY conclude that the sending client has taken responsibility for the conversation, and make appropriate user interface modifications.  For example, notifications could be suppressed on devices receiving the Carbon-copies.</li>
    </ul>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Handling of errors' anchor='errors'>
    <p>When a receiving server attempts to deliver a forked message, and that message bounces with an error for any reason, the receiving server MUST NOT forward that error back to the original sender.  The receiving server SHOULD use the sent element in the bounce to determine that an error is from a forked message.</p>
    <p>This rule is used to prevent some of the half-failure modes that have been an issue in other prototocols.</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Auto-responses' anchor='auto-responses'>
    <p>Clients that automatically respond to messages for any reason (e.g. when in the "dnd" presence show state) MUST take adequate care when enabling Carbons in order to prevent storms or loops.  Carbon copies of messages MUST NOT be auto-replied to under any circumstances.  Forked inbound messages SHOULD NOT be auto-replied to, unless the client has some way of ensuring no more than one auto-reply is sent from all of its user's resources.</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Mobile Considerations' anchor='mobile'>
    <p>Since mobile devices often must pay for network traffic based on usage, the enablement of Carbons for such devices should be undertaken advisedly.  More complicated mechanisms for controlling the Carbon-copying or forking of individual conversations may need to be added to deal with mobile clients in the future.</p>
  </section2>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>
  <p>The security model assumed by this document is that all of the resources for a single user are in the same trust boundary. Any forwarded copies received by a Carbon-enabled client MUST be from that user's bare JID; any copies that do not meet this requirement MUST be ignored.</p>
  <p>Outbound chat messages that are encrypted end-to-end are not often useful to receive on other resources.  As such, they should use the &lt;private/&gt; element specified above to avoid such copying, unless the encryption mechanism is able to accommodate this protocol.</p>
