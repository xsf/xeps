		<p>
			When installing massive amounts of Things into public networks care has to be taken to make installation simple, but at the same time secure so that the Things cannot be
			hijacked or hacked, making sure access to the Thing is controlled by the physical owner of the Thing. One of the main problems is how
			to match the characteristics of a Thing, like serial number, manufacturer, model, etc., with information automatically created by the Thing itself, like perhaps its JID, in
			an environment with massive amount of Things without rich user interfaces. Care has also to be taken when specifying rules for access rights and user privileges.
		</p>
		<p>
			This document provides a network architecture based on the XMPP protocol that provides a means to safely install, configure, find and connect massive amounts of Things together, and
			at the same time minimizing the risk that Things get hijacked. It also provides information how each individual step in the process can be performed with as little manual intervention
			as possible, aiming where possible at zero-configuration networking. Furthermore, this document specifies how to create a registry that allows simple access to public Things
			without risking their integrity unnecessarily.
		</p>
		<p>
			Internet of Things contains many different architectures and use cases. For this reason, the IoT standards have been divided into multiple XEPs according to the following table:
		</p>

				<dt>Momentary Value</dt>
				<dd>A momentary value represents a value measured at the time of the read-out.</dd>
			</di>
			<di>
				<dt>Node</dt>
				<dd>
					Graphs contain nodes and edges between nodes. In Internet of Things, sensors, actuators, meters, devices, gateways, etc., are often depicted as nodes whereas links between sensors (friendships)
					are depicted as edges. In abstract terms, it's easier to talk about a Node, rather than list different possible node types (sensors, actuators, meters, devices, gateways, etc.).
					Each Node has a Node ID.
				</dd>
			</di>
			<di>
				<dt>Node ID</dt>
				<dd>
					An ID uniquely identifying a node within its corresponding context. If a globally unique ID is desired, an architecture should be used using a universally accepted
					ID scheme.
				</dd>
			</di>
			<di>
				<dt>Parameter</dt>
				<dd>
					Readable and/or writable property on a node/device. The XEP-0326 &xep0326; deals with reading and writing parameters

				</dd>
			</di>
			<di>
				<dt>Precision</dt>
				<dd>
					In physics, precision determines the number of digits of precision. In sensor networks however, this definition is not easily applicable. Instead, precision
					determines, for example, the number of decimals of precision, or power of precision. Example: 123.200 MWh contains 3 decimals of precision. All entities parsing and
					delivering field information in sensor networks should always retain the number of decimals in a message.
				</dd>

					about Things in the network.
				</dd>
			</di>
			<di>
				<dt>Token</dt>
				<dd>
					A client, device or user can get a token from a provisioning server. These tokens can be included in requests to other entities in the network, so these entities can validate
					access rights with the provisioning server.

	<section1 topic='Use Cases' anchor='usecases'>
		<p>
			The life cycle of a Thing can be divided into multiple steps. The following sections will list many of these steps in possible order of occurrence during the
			life cycle of the Thing.
		</p>
		<section2 topic='Production' anchor='production'>
			<p>
				During production of a Thing, decisions have to be made whether the following parameters should be pre-configured, manually entered after installation or
				automatically found and/or created by the device if possible (zero-configuration networking):
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Address and domain of XMPP Server.
				</li>
				<li>
					JID of the Thing.
				</li>
				<li>
					JID of Thing Registry, if separate from the XMPP Server.
				</li>
				<li>
					JID of first Provisioning Server, if separate from Thing Registry or XMPP Server.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				A decision has to be made at this point if global/manufacturer/customer servers should be used, or if local resources should be searched for and used if found.
				The first option is easy to configure in a production environment and might have commercial significance,
				but cannot use local resources where available. The second leaves much responsibility to the Thing for finding local resources, but has the advantage of allowing for a more
				decentralized network architecture. A detailed discussion of the two alternatives goes beyond the scope of this specification, and will not be presented here.
			</p>
		</section2>
		<section2 topic='Installation' anchor='installation'>
			<p>
				Apart from physical installation, and connection to power and communication infrastructure, the installation phase of a Thing might also require manual entry of values that
				could not be set in the production environment. Since Things might have very limited human user interfaces, external tools might be required to provide this information. Due
				to its complexity, any manual entry of configuration parameters should be avoided, if possible. However, manual entry of some parameters might allow for Things to use local
				resources where such cannot be found nor set in a production environment.
			</p>
		</section2>
		<section2 topic='Finding XMPP Server' anchor='findingserver'>
			<p>
				If the address of an XMPP Server is not preconfigured, the Thing must attempt to find one in its local surroundings. This can be done using one of several methods:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>DHCP</li>
				<li>Multicast DNS</li>
				<li>SSDP/UPnP</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The following sections describe them in more detail.
			</p>
			<section3 topic='DHCP' anchor='dhcp'>
				<p>
					DHCP offers an internal structure for advertising configuration information to clients in a network.
					This includes configuration parameters and other control elements, which are transmitted in special marked data elements, called 'options', as described in
					<span class='ref'>
						<link url='http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3942'>RFC 3942</link>
					</span> <note>
						RFC 3942: Reclassifying Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 4 (DHCPv4) Options &lt;<link url='http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3942'>http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3942</link>&gt;.
					</note>.
				</p>
				<p>
					<link url='http://www.iana.org/assignments/bootp-dhcp-parameters/bootp-dhcp-parameters.txt'>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) Parameters</link> lists currently assigned 'options' by IANA.
					<strong>Note:</strong> There does exist no 'option' for XMPP at the moment.
					Options 224 to 254 are marked as 'site-specific option range' to support local (to a site) configuration options (i.e., reserved as 'Private Use').
				</p>
				<p>
					Possible codes for the XMPP server option:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Use 'site-specific option range'. Use of 'option-code' 224.</li>
					<li>
						<strong>TBD:</strong> Define and register DHCP and BOOTP option as described in <link url='#option'>Parameters for IoT Discovery</link>. Use of 'option-code' 84.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<section4 topic='XMPP Server Option' anchor='serveroption'>
					<p>
						This option specifies the name of the XMPP server.
						The name may or may not be qualified with the local domain name.
						See &rfc1035; for character set restrictions.
					</p>
					<p>
						The code for this option is 224 (for 'site-specific option range') or 84 (for <link url='#option'>DHCP and BOOTP Parameters for IoT Discovery</link>), and its minimum length is 1.
					</p>
					<example caption='IoT Discovery DHCP Option'>
						<![CDATA[

					<p>So, for example, if the machine name is "pronto", the code for the option is 224, the XMPP server option would be as follows:</p>

			<section3 topic='Multicast DNS (mDNS) and DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD)' anchor='dns'>
				<p>
					An introduction of mDNS/DNS-SD (e.g., how it works and terminology) is described in &xep0174; (i.e., sections [1.2] and [2]).
					For the purpose of IoT Discovery we are interested only in the "xmpp-client" service.
					An XMPP server MUST publish four different kinds of DNS records to advertise its availability using the services of type "xmpp-client".
					An XMPP chat client (actually its mDNS daemon) can send out multicast DNS queries for services of type "xmpp-client".
					<strong>Note:</strong> the service of type "xmpp-client" is the reservered name for client-to-server connections by IANA, as described in &rfc6120;.
				</p>
				<section4 topic='DNS Records' anchor='dnsrecords'>
					<p>In order to advertise its availability, a server MUST publish four different kinds of DNS records:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>A PTR record of the following form:</p>
							<example caption='PTR record'>
								<![CDATA[
   _xmpp-client._tcp.local. PTR machine._xmpp-client._tcp.local.]]>
							</example>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>An address ("A" or "AAAA") record of the following form (where the IP address can be either an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address):</p>
							<example caption='A record'>
								<![CDATA[
   machine.local. A ip-address]]>
							</example>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>A SRV record of the following form:</p>
							<example caption='SRV record'>
								<![CDATA[
   machine._xmpp-client._tcp.local <ttl> SRV <priority> <weight> port-number machine.local.]]>
							</example>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								A TXT record whose name is the same as the SRV record and whose value follows the format described in the <link url='#txt'>TXT Record</link> section of this document, consisting of a set of strings that typically represent a series of key-value pairs such as the following:
							</p>
							<example caption='TXT record'>
								<![CDATA[
   txtvers=1
   ordom=example.com
   regis=registry
   provis=provisioning]]>
							</example>
							<p>Note: The DNS-SD specification stipulates that the TXT record MUST be published, but that it MAY contain no more than a single zero byte (e.g., if the server does not wish to publish any personal information).</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						For the purpose of IoT Discovery we are interested only in the "xmpp-client" service.
						An XMPP server MUST publish four different kinds of DNS records to advertise its availability using the services of type "xmpp-client".
						An XMPP chat client (actually its mDNS daemon) can send out multicast DNS queries for services of type "xmpp-client".
						<strong>Note:</strong> the service of type "xmpp-client" is the reservered name for client-to-server connections by IANA, as described in &rfc6120;.
					</p>
					<p>So, for example, if the machine name is "pronto", the IP address is "10.2.1.188", and the personal information, the DNS records would be as follows:</p>
					<example caption='IoT Discovery DNS Records Example'>
						<![CDATA[
   _xmpp-client._tcp.local. PTR pronto._xmpp-client._tcp.local.

   pronto._xmpp-client._tcp.local. SRV 5222 pronto.local.

   pronto.local. A 10.2.1.188

   pronto._xmpp-client._tcp.local. IN TXT
   "txtvers=1"
   "ordom=example.com"
   "regis=registry"
   "provis=provisioning"]]>
					</example>
					<p>The IPv4 and IPv6 addresses associated with a machine might vary depending on the local network to which the machine is connected. For example, on an Ethernet connection the physical address might be "192.168.0.100" but when the machine is connected to a wireless network the physical address might change to "10.10.1.188". See &rfc3927; for details.</p>
					<p>If the machine name asserted by a client is already taken by another machine on the network, the client MUST assert a different machine name, which SHOULD be formed by adding the character "-" and digit "1" to the end of the machine name string (e.g., "pronto-1"), adding the character "-" and digit "2" if the resulting machine name is already taken (e.g., "pronto-2"), and similarly incrementing the digit until a unique machine name is constructed.</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Note:</strong> DNS-SD enables service definitions to include a TXT record that specifies parameters to be used in the context of the relevant service type. For detailed information refer to &xep0174; (Link-Local Messaging - TXT Record).

			<p>
				There are two types of tags: Tags with string values and tags with numerical values. The distinction is important, since the type of value affects how
				comparisons are made later when performing searches in the registry.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Thing should only register parameters required to be known by the owner of the Thing. Dynamic meta information must be avoided at this point.
				To claim the ownership of the Thing, the owner needs to present the same meta information as registered by the Thing. Before an owner has claimed
				ownership of the Thing, it will not be returned in any search results. A list of predefined meta tag names can be found in the <link url='#tags'>Meta Tags</link>
				section below.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Thing can register itself as many times as it wants, and the response is always empty. Only one record per resource-less JID must be created. A new
				registration overrides any previous information, including meta tags previously reported but not available in the new registration. Once a Thing has been
				claimed by an owner, it should not register itself again, unless it is reset and the installation process restarted.
			</p>
			<p>
				If the Thing tries to register itself even though the Thing has already been claimed in the registry, the registry must not update any meta data in the registry, and instead
				respond with the following response. When the thing receives this, it can safely extract the JID of the owner and switch its internal state to claimed.

		<section2 topic='Register Thing behind Concentrator' anchor='registerconcentrator'>
			<p>
				A Thing might reside behind a gateway or concentrator and might not be directly connected to the XMPP network itself, as is described in &xep0326;. In these cases, there are three optional
				attributes that can be used to identify the Thing behind the JID: The <strong>nodeId</strong> attribute gives the ID of the Thing (a.k.a. "Node"). The Node might reside in
				specific Data Source (large systems might have multiple sources of nodes). In this case, the data source is specified in the <strong>sourceId</strong> attribute. Normally, the Node ID
				is considered to be unique within the concentrator. If multiple data sources are available, the Node ID is unique within the data source. However, a third attribute allows the uniqueness
				to be restricted to a given <strong>cacheType</strong>. Finally, it is the triple (<strong>nodeId</strong>, <strong>sourceId</strong>, <strong>cacheType</strong>) which guarantees
				uniqueness within the concentrator.
			</p>
			<p>
				For a Thing controlled by a concentrator to register itself in the Thing Registry, it simply adds the optional attributes <strong>nodeId</strong>, <strong>sourceId</strong>
				and <strong>cacheType</strong> as appropriate to the registration request, as follows:

		</section2>
		<section2 topic='Claiming Ownership of a Thing' anchor='claim'>
			<p>
				As mentioned above, the owner of the Thing must provide the information provided by the Thing to the Registry, in order to claim ownership over it. To avoid the
				possibility that somebody can guess the information, the information must necessarily be long. This creates the problem of transfer of information. One method to solve this
				is through the use of QR-codes. Such codes can be either printed on a sticker and put on the Thing itself, its wrapping, or displayed on its display when not claimed.
				This QR-code can then be photographed by a smart phone or tablet, decoded and the information retrieved can be used in the ownership claim call.
			</p>
			<p>
				If QR-codes are used to transfer Thing meta data for ownership claims, it must be generated as follows: To the string "IoTDisco" is appended all meta tags in order.
				Each tag name is prefixed by a semi-colon (;), and if the tag is numeric, the tag is prefixed by an additional hash sign (#). Each tag value is prefixed by a colon (:).
				If the meta value contains semi-colons or back-slashes, each one is prefixed by a back-slash. When decoding the string, this allows the decoder to correctly differ
				between tag delimiters and characters belonging to tag values. A tag name must never contain colon, hash sign or white space characters.
			</p>
			<p>
				The above meta data would therefore generate the string:

		<section2 topic='Update Meta Information about Thing in Registry' anchor='update'>
			<p>
				Once a Thing has been claimed and chooses to reside as a public Thing in the registry, it can update its meta information at any time. This meta information
				will be available in searches made to the registry by third parties and is considered public. However, the Thing should be connected to a provisioning server
				at this point, so that correct decisions can be made regarding to friendship, readout and control requests made by parties other than the owner.
			</p>
			<p>
				Meta information updated in this way will only overwrite tags provided in the request, and leave other tags previously reported as is. To remove a string-valued tag,
				it should be updated with an empty value. It is also recommended that key meta information required to claim ownership of the Thing after a factory reset is
				either removed, truncated or otherwise modified after it has been claimed so that third parties with physical access to a public Thing cannot hijack it by searching
				for it, extracting its meta information from the registry, then resetting it and then claiming ownership of it.
			</p>
			<p>
				To update meta data about itself, a Thing simply sends a request to the Thing Registry, as follows:
			</p>
			<example caption='Update Meta Data request'>

   <iq type='set'

			<p>
				If the Thing resides behind a concentrator, the request must contain those of the attributes <strong>nodeId</strong>, <strong>sourceId</strong>
				and <strong>cacheType</strong> that are required to access the Thing, as follows:

			</example>
			<p>
				However, if the Thing is not found in the registry, probably because the owner has removed it from the registry, an error response is returned. When receiving
				such a response, the Thing should assume it is the owner who has removed it from the registry, and that further meta data updates are not desired. The Thing
				can then unfriend the registry and stop further meta data updates. The error response from the registry would look as follows:

			</example>
			<p>
				If the Thing on the other hand is found in the Registry, but is not claimed, the registry must not update any meta data in the registry, and instead
				respond with the following response. When the thing receives this, the Thing can assume it has been disowned, and perform a new registration in the Registry so
				that it can be re-claimed.

				The <strong>offset</strong> attribute tells the registry the number of responses to skip before returning found things. It provides a mechanism to page result sets

				If tag names are not found corresponding to the names provided in the search, the result set will always be empty. There's a reserved tag named <strong>KEY</strong>
				that can be used to provide information shared only between things and their owners. If a search contains an operator referencing this tag name, the result set
				must also always be empty. Searches on <strong>KEY</strong> MUST never find things. Furthermore, search results must never return <strong>KEY</strong> tags.

			</example>
			<p>
				When receiving the acknowledgement from the Thing, the Thing is set as an unclaimed Thing in the Registry. Furthermore, all tags corresponding to the Thing are removed from the
				registry, and a random KEY tag is added of sufficient complexity to make sure other clients cannot claim the Thing by guessing. Finally, an empty response is returned, to
				acknowledge that the Thing has been disowned, as follows:

				A client must treat the connection between a Thing Registry differently if it is hosted as a client, having a JID, or if it is hosted as a Jabber Server Component.
				If it is hosted as a server component, there's no need for the thing to become friends with the Thing Registry. Messages and requests can be made directly to the
				server component without having to add it to the roster or request presence subscriptions. If the Thing Registry is hosted as a client, having a JID (@ in the address),

				It is up to the Thing Registry to choose which tags it persists and which tags it doesn't. To avoid the possibility of malicious reporting of tags, some limit should be
				imposed on what tags are supported. As a minimum, a Thing Registry must support all predefined tags, as listed above.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Note:</strong> Meta Tag names are case insensitive. In this document, all tag names have been written using upper case letters.

		</section2>
		<section2 topic='Friendships between Things and Registry' anchor='friendships'>
			<p>
				In the case the Thing Registry is not the XMPP Server to which the Thing is connected, a friendship relationship between the Thing and the Thing Registry needs to be handled.
				To minimize the number of concurrent friends the Thing Registry needs to maintain, a Thing must only maintain an active friendship with the registry if it needs to
				communicate with the registry. This means that unless updating meta data frequently, the Thing must unfriend the Registry when done with its communication. If only
				updating meta data intermittently, the friendship can be reestablished when needed, and removed when done.
			</p>

	<section1 topic='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>
		<section2 topic='Jabber Components Protocol' anchor='jcp'>
			<p>
				The &xep0114; provides an elegant way to introduce external services as server components using a third port into the server (the first two being the client-to-server port
				and the server-to-server port). But since XEP-0114 is historical, meaning it is not guaranteed to conform to v1.0 of the XMPP specification, it has some serious security
				issues:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>It lacks SSL/TLS support, or the starttls element to switch to TLS after connecting. This makes it possible to sniff traffic in this port.</li>
				<li>It lacks SASL authentication. Instead a simple handshake is performed</li>
				<li>There is no way to actually verify that the server is the server. This makes it possible to create a simple Man-in-the-middle attack.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				For these reasons, it is not recommended that a Thing Registry service, publishing itself as a Jabber Server Component, does so from outside of the network. Instead,
				the Thing Registry should be installed on the same server or on a server in the same local area network, so that the Jabber Component protocol port is closed to the
				Internet.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since it is not guaranteed that an XMPP Server operator allows installation of third party products (such as a Thing Registry), the option to host a Thing Registry using
				a normal JID is still available. It can be used in proof of concepts, etc. For scalability issues it is recommended that the Thing Registry be hosted as a Jabber Server
				Component when the population of Things grows.
			</p>
		</section2>
		<section2 topic='Hijacking predefined JIDs' anchor='hijackingjids'>
			<p>
				If using predefined user names when searching for a Thing Registry or Provisioning Server, care must be taken to which XMPP Server things connect.
				It might be possible for third parties to register these predefined account names, and pretend to be a Thing Registry or Provisioning Server and in this way hijack
				unsuspecting Things. If installing things using this method of finding a Thing Registry or Provisioning Server, these accounts must be registered beforehand, to make
				sure the things cannot be hijacked.
			</p>
		</section2>
		<section2 topic='Hijacking things in public areas' anchor='hijackingthings'>
			<p>
				The combination of visible key meta information (perhaps in a visible QR-code) and a factory default reset button on a Thing, opens up the possibility to hijack the Thing.
				To avoid this, at least one of the two should be removed after successful installation. Either the key meta information (QR-code) should be placed on the package or separate
				paper and not on the thing itself, or the factory default reset button should be sealed or hidden and only accessible by licensed maintenance personell. If using an electronic
				means to present the key meta information (for instance by displayed a QR-code on a display on the thing), care should be taken so that the information cannot be displayed
				without breaking a seal, or other means to protect the Thing.
			</p>
			<p>
				Regardless the above security measures, a Thing can be hijacked by a third party in the time window between successful installation of the device and until the correct owner
				has claimed ownership of the device. Minimizing this time window, and using a shared secret (KEY tag) between the Thing and its owner, decreases the possibility of getting the
				thing hijacked.
			</p>
		</section2>
		<section2 topic='Key meta information in searches' anchor='keysearch'>
			<p>
				Care should be taken what key meta information is used to accept an ownership claim. After a successful claim, this meta information is still available in the registry,
				at least until the Thing is removed from the registry. While public in the registry, the meta information can be searched and presented to third parties. Access to this
				information can help third parties to hijack Things, if they can reset them to factory default settings.
			</p>
			<p>
				To avoid this, the Thing can do three things after a successful ownership claim:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Including a <strong>KEY</strong> tag in the key meta information. The <strong>KEY</strong> tag is not searchable nor presented in search results.
				</li>
				<li>
					Remove, truncate or change some key meta information after a successful ownership claim. Partial information is not sufficient for a successful ownership claim.
				</li>
				<li>
					Remove the Thing from the registry.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</section2>
		<section2 topic='KEY tag' anchor='key'>
			<p>
				The <strong>KEY</strong> tag is unique in that it is not searchable nor available is search results. For this reason it is ideal for providing secrets shared only
				between the Thing and the owner. By providing a sufficiently long KEY value in the key meta information required to claim the Thing, guessing the information even though
				the other meta information is available, will be sufficiently hard to make it practically impossible.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even though the <strong>KEY</strong> tag is not searchable or available in search results, it should be emptied by the Thing after a successful claim, just to make sure
				the key cannot be learned by looking into the database of the registry, or by some other means.
			</p>
		</section2>
		<section2 topic='Tag name spam' anchor='tagspam'>
			<p>
				This document does not limit tag names or the number of tags that can be used by Things. This opens up the possibility of tag spam. Malicious things could fill the database
				of the registry by reporting random tag names until the database is full.
			</p>
			<p>
				To prevent such malicious attacks, the registry could limit the tags it allows to be stored in the database. The registry must however allow the storage of the predefined
				tag names defined in this document. If it has a configurable list of approved tags that can be stored, or if it allows any tags is an implementation decision.
			</p>
		</section2>
		<section2 topic='External services for creating QR-codes' anchor='externalqr'>
			<p>
				If using external services when creating QR-codes, like the Google Charts API used in this document, make sure HTTPS is used and certificates validated. If HTTP is used,
				meta-data tags used in Thing Registry registrations can be found out by sniffing the network, making it possible to hijack the corresponding devices.
